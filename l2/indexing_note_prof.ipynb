      "I am not going into any details about dough consistency, tips for using a pasta machine, etc. I will only say that if you've never made fresh pasta before (especially gluten-free) you'll need some practice before it comes out right. I started by soaking the chia seeds in the water for 15 minutes, and stirred to create an egg-like mixture. (I think I only ended up using about a 1/4 cup of the chia mixture) Add the flour a little at a time to the chia seed mixture, until you end up with a good firm ball of dough. Roll out dough using a pasta machine, and cut how you like for fettuccine, lasagne, etc. I made thicker fettuccine with it because I was concerned that the seeds might create voids that would allow the pasta to break or fall apart if I went too thin. I cooked this pasta immediately after preparing. I typically dry my fresh pasta in the freezer or by hanging before cooking, and I assume you can do that with this too.\n",

When the cheese is thoroughly melted, slowly add the milk, stirring constantly. The sauce should have a grainy texture once it has enough milk. Add salt and sugar to taste. Sharper cheeses generally need more sugar and less salt. (Note: I tried using low fat mayonnaise the other day, and it turned out much sweeter than I wanted. It still tasted great on the broccoli, but apparently low-fat mayo has sugar in it, so check your ingredients! ). Pour over cooked broccoli or fried/poached eggs and serve.

When the pieces are firm, scoop them into a freezer safe plastic bag. freeze until ready to use. Do not thaw before cooking, put them straight into boiling water.

Sprinkle in cold water, 1 or 2 drops at a time, and mix with spatula until it comes together in a dough that holds its shape when squeezed. Transfer dough to a work surface and press into a thick, flattened disk. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Roll dough out on a floured work surface to about 1/8-inch thick. Use a pizza cutter to cut 1-inch wide strips from the dough. Cut strips crosswise into rectangles about 1 1/2-inches long. Use the back of a bamboo skewer to punch 5 small holes into each cracker. Arrange crackers onto prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until crackers are browned and crisp, about 15 minutes. Let stand about 3 minutes for crackers to cool and release from the foil. Let cool completely before serving.\n",

      "Make a cheesecloth bag that's 4 layers thick, and about 12\" long by 6 1/2 \" wide. The bottom 8\" or so should taper to a point. Place the cottage cheese into a colander, over a bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place a weight on top. Let it drain for 2 - 3 hours. Using an electric mixer, mix all the ingredients until they're well blended. Place the cheesecloth bag in a large bowl, with the seems facing out. Pack the mixture in the bag, to about 4\" from the top of the cheesecloth. Twist the top, and tie it being careful not to get it so tight that you're forcing the cheese out of the pores of the bag. Cover a sheet pan with plastic, then place the filled cheese bag on top. Place the bag so that the seem is in the center of the back, and front, it should almost look like a heart. One end of this sheet pan should be elevated to permit the cheese to drain. You can use either a bowl , or 2 coffee cups to do this. Place a bowl underneath the bottom of the cheese, to catch the liquid that will drain out. Cover the cheese with another piece of plastic wrap, and set another sheet pan on top. Carefully place a weight on top of the top pan. But, be careful because the cheese is real soft and the top pan will want to slide off once the weight is on it. Store in a cool place, or in your refrigerator for 3 days, being sure to check it so that the weight doesn't fall off. My Mom used to let this rest in the basement, because it was nice and cool, and she used a Belgian Brick that we would have to check now and then to insure that it didn't fall off. When the cheese has dried out, cut off the cheesecloth bag with scissors, carefully so as not to break up the cheese. The cheese should be real firm to the touch. Place it flat on a platter, and store in your refrigerator until Easter morning. If you haven't gotten enough moisture out of the cheese, you will have a cheese that won't stay together. You can start this process a full week before Easter.\n",

      "Crust: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Spray pie plate with nonstick spray. Whisk together dry ingredients (flour, 1 teaspoon salt, baking powder). Blend in cold butter cubes until it forms a meal consistency. Blend in 3/4 cup of whole milk (you may need slightly more, depending on the texture). This should form a biscuit-like dough. Gather the dough into a ball and divide in half. Roll out the first half of dough to fit your pie plate (usually about 12 round). I roll the dough right on a well-floured counter, but you can use waxed paper or plastic wrap, if you prefer. Its a pretty sticky dough, so youll probably need extra flour with any method. Place the rolled-out crust in your pie plate and trim off any excess. You can roll out the second crust now or put the dough in the fridge and roll it right before you place it on top of the filling. I usually par-bake the bottom crust for about 8 to 10 minutes to avoid sogginess. Filling: Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions and saute until edges are clear and soft. Add cubed chicken and brown. Add broccoli (if using frozen, you may want to nuke it for a few minutes first) and stir. Add shredded cheese, cream of mushroom soup, milk and stir together. Heat for a few minutes to thicken. Pour the warm filling into the bottom crust. Place the top crust over the filling and pinch the edges to close. Brush the top crust with 2 tablespoons melted butter and sprinkle a few pinches of kosher salt. Be sure to cut steam vents in the top crust after. Bake for about 25 minutes or until crust is golden on edges and filling is bubbling slightly.\n",

      "FOR THE COOKIES: In bowl of standing mixer fitted with flat beater, mix flour, sugar, and salt on low speed until combined, about 5 seconds. With mixer running on low, add butter 1 piece at a time; continue to mix until mixture looks crumbly and slightly wet, about 1 minute longer. Add vanilla and cream cheese and mix on low until dough just begins to form large clumps, about 30 seconds. Remove bowl from mixer; knead dough by hand in bowl for 2 to 3 turns to form large cohesive mass. Turn out dough onto countertop; divide in half, pat into two 4-inch disks, wrap each in plastic, and refrigerate until they begin to firm up, 20 to 30 minutes. (Can be refrigerated up to 3 days or frozen up to 2 weeks; defrost in refrigerator before using. ). Adjust oven rack to middle position; heat oven to 375 degrees. Roll out 1 dough disk to even 1/8-inch thickness between 2 large sheets parchment paper; slide rolled dough on parchment onto baking sheet and chill until firm, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, repeat with second disk. Working with first portion of rolled dough, cut into desired shapes using cookie cutter(s) and place shapes on parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing them about 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake until light golden brown, about 10 minutes, rotating baking sheet halfway through baking time. Repeat with second portion of rolled dough. (Dough scraps can be patted together, chilled, and re-rolled once.) Cool cookies on wire rack to room temperature. FOR THE GLAZE: Whisk cream cheese and 2 tablespoons milk in medium bowl until combined and no lumps remain. Whisk in confectioners' sugar until smooth, adding remaining milk as needed until glaze is thin enough to spread easily. Drizzle or spread scant teaspoon glaze with back of spoon onto each cooled cookie, as desired.\n",

      "In a medium bowl whisk together both flours, poppy seeds, sesame seeds, salt, and baking powder. Add the oil and stir until combined. Add the water and stir to combine and create a dough. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead 4 to 5 times. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, cover with a tea towel and allow to rest for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. For a thin snacking cracker: On a lightly floured surface, roll out 1 piece of dough to 1/16-inch and place on a parchment lined baking sheet. If there is room on the sheet pan, repeat with a second piece of dough. Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 4 minutes then flip and bake for an additional 2 to 3 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a cooling rack. When cool, break into desired size pieces. Repeat procedure with remaining dough. For a thicker dipping cracker: On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough as above but to 1/8-inch thick. Bake for 6 minutes on the first side, then flip and bake another 4 to 6 minutes. For super even thickness and easy rolling: Roll out using a lightly floured pasta roller. Flatten the dough until it will pass through the first setting and go to the highest number that your pasta roller will allow without tearing the dough. Bake according to the thin cracker instructions. Note: Baking times will vary depending on exact thickness of dough and oven temperature, so watch them closely. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\n",

About 30 minutes before baking, adjust oven rack to lowest position, place a large heavy-bottomed Dutch oven (with lid) on rack, and heat oven to 500 degrees. Lightly flour top of dough and, using razor blade or sharp knife, make one 6-inch-long, 1/2-inch-deep slit along top of dough. Carefully remove pot from oven and remove lid. Pick up dough by lifting parchment overhang and lower into pot (let any excess parchment hang over pot edge). Cover pot and place in oven.

There is a certain amount of technique to successfully grilling cheese. An essential is that the grill must be very hot. To cook directly on the grill, first set the prepared cheese slices out at room temperature for a couple of hours. As the surface dries out, a hard film starts to form. This is what will keep you from ending up with a gooey puddle in the bottom of your grill. If you don't quite feel up to cooking the cheese directly on the grill, you can use a pie plate or aluminum foil. Cook about three minutes on each side. Serve hot.\n",

Place the handle of a wooden spoon in the center of a crisp. Fold in the two sides (at the 4 oclock and 8 oclock position) around the spoon. Hold and squeeze for a minute. Slide crisp off spoon. Repeat until all crisps are shaped (shaping two at a time will speed up the process).

Equal parts of basil pesto and olive oil mixed together with Parmesan or Romano cheese. Plus some roughly chopped sundried or SEMI-dried tomatoes, sliced black olives and LOTS of grated Mozzarella cheese, salt and lost of freshly ground black pepper! Cranberry jelly, shredded chicken, sliced Brie! Mozzarella cheese, shredded chicken and sliced avocado! THE BREAD. Place all the above ingredients in the order I have listed into the bread machine. Select the dough cycle and press start! When the dough cycle is complete, take the dough out of the machine and place in well greased bowl, and roll the dough around (in the bowl) thus 'coating' it in oil. Cover and leave to rise in a warm place for about 1/2 an hour. Knead the risen dough lightly. To shape and bake: roll the dough into a circle. Place on well greased baking tray or pizza pan. Then add a topping of your choice and bake at 225'C. NOTE: for a nice crisp and very thin pizza, bake BEFORE adding the topping AND after!\n",

If you need to add a bit more water (or flour) do so. When you are done mixing, shape the dough into a large ball. Now cut into twelve equal-sized pieces. Gently rub each piece with a bit of olive oil, shape into a small ball and place on a plate. Cover with a clean dishtowel or plastic wrap and let rest at room temperature for 30 - 60 minutes. While the dough is resting, preheat your oven to 450F degrees. Insert a pizza stone if you have one. When the dough is done resting, flatten one dough ball. Using a rolling pin or a pasta machine, shape into a flat strip of dough - I can usually get down to the 4 setting on my pasta machine w/o trouble. Pull the dough out a bit thinner by hand (the way you might pull pizza dough). You can also cut the dough into whatever shape you like at this point. Set dough on a floured (or cornmeal dusted) baking sheet, add any extra toppings, and slide into the oven (onto the pizza stone). Repeat the process for the remaining dough balls, baking in small batches. If you don't have a pizza stone, bake crackers a few at a time on baking sheets. Bake until deeply golden, and let cool before eating - you will get more crackery snap.\n",

      "Add the flour, dried yeast, sugar, salt, warm water and milk to a bowl and mix everything together with your hand. Once the dough has gathered together, turn out onto a surface and knead for 5-10 minutes. It may look soft and sticky like this, but it will form properly if you keep persevering. When the dough has been kneaded it may feel a little more runny than your usual bread dough. When you've finished the kneading, keep rolling the dough into a ball until the surface is smooth. Lightly grease the bowl with oil and place the ball of dough seam-down inside. Wrap the top of the bowl with some lightly greased cling film. Let the dough prove. If it's summer, just leave to prove at room temperature. I put the bowl in a styrofoam box alongside some cups of hot water. Leave to prove for 30 minutes. Once the dough has doubled in size, it's ready. Turn the dough out onto a dusted surface and lightly press out any excess gas with your hands. Split the dough into 4 equal parts and roll them into balls. Cover with a damp tea towel and leave to rest for 15 minutes. In the meantime, make the cheese. Combine the ingredients marked with * and mix together. Use your hand to mix as if you were kneading until a ball forms. Split the cheese mixture into 4 equal parts and shape into flat ovals to make them easy to wrap. Use your hands to stretch out the dough from Step 8, place the cheese in the middle and wrap the dough around. Once wrapped, pinch the dough securely closed with your fingers. Turn the naan over and roll into a circle shape with a dusted rolling pin. Cook in a frying pan without oil. Once the bottom has turned golden, flip the naan over. A non-stick frying pan is best for this job. Once both sides are cooked, your naan is ready Of course they taste great with curry but please try them on their own too!\n",

Little bubbles of soy milk forming on the sides of the pan are what to look for for the next step. Add the salt and give a good stir to dissolve. Remove pan from heat, and add the lemon juice. Stir just enough to get the lemon juice distributed. You should see some clumping in the soy milk. That's good! That's what we want to see. Let the mixture cool. Line a collander with cheese cloth (don't skimp on the cheese cloth. I tried a plastic mesh strainer and the holes were too big! you can buy the cheese cloth at any grocery store). You want to have enough of the cheesecloth hanging over the edge of the collander to grab and tie for aging the soy cheese. Put the collander in the sink and pour/scrape all the soy milk curds into the collander. Let it sit like that until the soy milk \"whey\" drains. (you could use the \"whey\" for noodles, pastas, soups, or whatever if you don't want to throw it away -- ) Take the cheesecloth out of collander and bring all the edges together, with the lump of soy ricotta in the middle. Tie the cheesecloth with a string and hang the cheese so that it continues to drain. Don't squeeze it -- let gravity and a little time do the work for you. When it stops dripping, open the cheese cloth and transfer the ricotta to a covered container. Refrigerate and use as you would use ricotta cheese. NOTE: When I made this, I used the vanilla flavored soy milk. I think it gave the ricotta product more of that sweet cream taste, and I think I'd rather have that than the straight soy flavor. NOTE: If you wanted to flavor this, with garlic powder or herbs, do it when the milk is in the saucepan. You can add sun dried tomatos and such after the cheese has been strained, but it gives a different texture and presentation with chunky sized add ons later.\n",

Knead on lightly floured board till smooth. Place in greased bowl (spray w Pam), cover w/ towel and let rise until doubled in bulk. (I prewarm my oven and turn off and put dough in a bowl in the oven to double in the warm oven for approximately 45 minutes. ). Punch down, shape into loaves and place in greased pans (Pam) and let rise until doubled. (I also do this second rise in the prewarmed oven for approximately 1 hour. ). If desired, brush w/ beaten egg, before baking. It gives a nice shine to the bread when finished baking. (I have not done this yet, but mine aren't as pretty as Gram's either ;). Bake 350 degrees until nicely browned, 30 to 60 minutes, depending on size of loaf pan. Check the bottom of loaf to see if it is browned.

      "FOOD PROCESSOR METHOD. Cut the butter into small (about 3/4-inch) cubes. Wrap it in plastic wrap and freeze it until frozen solid, at least 30 minutes. Place the flour, salt and baking powder in resealable gallon-size freezer bag and freeze for at least 30 minutes. Place the flour mixture in food processor with the metal blade and process for a few seconds to combine. Set the bag aside for later use here. Cut the cream cheese into 3 or 4 pieces and add it to the flour. Process for about 20 seconds or until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the frozen butter cubes and pulse until none of the butter is larger than the size of a pea. (Toss with a fork to see it better.) Remove the processor cover and sprinkle in the water and vinegar. Pulse until most of the butter is reduced to size of small peas. The mixture will be in particles and will not hold together. Spoon half the dough into the plastic bag. (For a double-crust pie, it is easiest to divide the mixture in half at this point) Holding both ends of the bag opening with your fingers, knead the mixture by alternately pressing it, from the outside of the bag, with the knuckles and heels of your hands until the mixture holds together in one piece and feels slightly stretchy when pulled. Remove the dough from the bag and wrap it with plastic wrap, and flatten it into a disc. Repeat with remaining pie dough. Refrigerate the discs for at least 45 minutes, preferably overnight. Store refrigerated, up to 2 days; frozen, up to 3 months.\n",

      "Note: The listed prep time is simply for preparing the dough. The dough then needs to be refrigerated for 2-24 hours before slicing. Toast the nuts on a dry pan in a 350 F oven for 10-15 minutes until aromatic and flavorful. While the nuts are toasting, coarsely chop then cover the Craisins with boiling water in a small bowl. Let them soak/soften for 10-15 minutes. Drain, pat dry and allow Craisins and nuts to cool while proceeding with next steps. In a medium sized bowl, beat butter, salt, black and red pepper until fluffy. Add cheese(s) and mix until all is creamed together. Add flour a little at a time and mix until combined. With mixer on low, or with a wooden spoon, gently stir in the nuts and Craisins. Divide dough in half and roll each half into a log about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in cellophane and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Chilling for 24 hours is better, but youre just looking for the dough to be firm enough to cut. Remove plastic wrap and slice logs into 1/4 inch rounds. Place rounds about an inch apart on a parchment lined baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 12-14 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pan and allow to rest on cooling racks until room temperature. Store in an airtight container for up to a month. Good luck keeping them around for very long. They disappear quickly! The baby shower I was attending had lots of sweets planned, so I wanted to bring something savory. Shortbread cookies are a favorite of ours, so removing the sugar and adding crunchy nuts, sweet/tart Craisins and pungent sharp cheese really fit the bill. These were a huge hit and the only complaint was that people couldnt stay out of them!\n",

      "1. FOR THE FILLING: Combine brown sugar, granulated sugar, cinnamon, and salt in bowl. Stir in melted butter and vanilla until mixture resembles wet sand; set aside. 2. FOR THE DOUGH: Grease dark 9-inch round cake pan, line with parchment paper, and grease parchment. Pour 1/4 cup milk in small bowl and microwave until 110 degrees, 15 to 20 seconds. Stir in yeast and 1 teaspoon sugar and let sit until mixture is bubbly, about 5 minutes. 3. Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and remaining 5 teaspoons sugar together in large bowl. Stir in 2 tablespoons butter, yeast mixture, and remaining 1 cup milk until dough forms (dough will be sticky). Transfer dough to well-floured counter and knead until smooth ball forms, about 2 minutes. 4. Roll dough into 12 by 9-inch rectangle, with long side parallel to counter edge. Brush dough all over with 2 tablespoons butter, leaving 1/2-inch border on far edge. Sprinkle dough evenly with filling, then press filling firmly into dough. Using bench scraper or metal spatula, loosen dough from counter. Roll dough away from you into tight log and pinch seam to seal. 5. Roll log seam side down and cut into 8 equal pieces. Stand buns on end and gently re-form ends that were pinched during cutting. Place 1 bun in center of prepared pan and others around perimeter of pan, seam sides facing inches Brush tops of buns with remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Cover buns loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 30 minutes. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. 6. Discard plastic and bake buns until edges are well browned, 23 to 25 minutes. Loosen buns from sides of pan with paring knife and let cool for 5 minutes. Invert large plate over cake pan. Using potholders, flip plate and pan upside down; remove pan and parchment. Reinvert buns onto wire rack, set wire rack inside parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet, and let cool for 5 minutes. 7. FOR THE GLAZE: Place cream cheese in large bowl and whisk in butter, milk, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Whisk in sugar until smooth.

Divide into 4 - 6 portions, and roll into balls. Let rest for 15 minutes. Press the air out again, flatten the dough, and roll out with a rolling pin into 10 - 12 cm diameter circles. Place on a baking sheet and let them rise for the second time (2nd rising). (30 minutes in the oven with the bread-rising function is an estimate.) Preheat the oven to 190C. Make little dents at 2 cm intervals on the dough with your fingers (or with a 1 cm diameter stick). Brush with the olive oil, and sprinkle with grated cheese, minced rosemary, and garlic powder. Bake in the oven for 8 minutes and they're done. Let cool for 5 - 10 minutes, and enjoy. You can stretch out the dough in a baking sheet instead of making small individual breads. Cut into pieces at the end. (I doubled the ingredients in this photo). I used the same amount as in this recipe and made one huge bread.\n",

Tie the string to the midpoint of the handle of a long wooden spoon, and suspend the ball of yogurt over a bowl wide and deep enough to allow the ball to hang freely a few inches above the bottom. After four to five hours, discard any liquid that has drained from the yogurt into the bowl. Remove the ball from the spoon, and untie the cheesecloth.

Mix the ingredients together on low speed using the dough hook just until the dough begins to come together (it will look a little rough), about 4 minutes. Increase the speed to medium-high and mix until the dough is smooth, 2 more minutes. Add the cheese and onion and continue to mix on medium speed until the cheese and onions are evenly distributed throughout the dough, about 1 minute. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Knead by hand until the cheese and onions are completely worked into the dough. (The dough will feel rather tight.) Gather it into a smooth ball. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let the dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Fold the dough gently over on itself in three or four places, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and cut it into 20 equal pieces. Cover the pieces and let them rest until nice and relaxed, about 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or grease lightly. Round each piece of dough into a smooth ball and place in even rows on the prepared baking sheets. Cover and let rise until the dough springs back when lightly touched but does not collapse, 30 minutes. Make a small slit down the center of each roll with a very sharp paring knife or a razor blade. Dust the tops of the rolls lightly with rye flour, if desired. Bake until the rolls have a golden brown crust and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom, 15-18 minutes.

Stir in the drained fruits and pour the mixture into a square 2-quart glass dish. Cover and refrigerate for about 1 hour, or until the gelatin is almost set. To make the cheese layer, pour the gelatin mix in a blender and add the boiling water. Blend the mixture at low speed with the lid slightly ajar for 1 minute or until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Add the orange juice and blend to mix well. Add the cream cheese and blend until the mixture is smooth. Pour the cheese mixture over the fruit mixture in the dish. Chill for at least 4 hours or until firm. Cut into squares to serve.\n",

      "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Combine the dry ingredients and mix well. Make a well in the center, and then add each wet ingredient. Mix all together gently. Dough should be light and airy. There will be enough dough for five or six shortcakes. Use a spoon to drop dollops of the dough onto a small nonstick or lightly oiled cookie sheet. Press the center of each shortcake to flatten it a bit and create an indentation for filling. I like to leave them irregularly shaped instead of perfectly round. Bake for 12-13 minutes, or until the tops are just starting to turn golden. After they've cooled for a bit, slice them in half horizontally. Use a combination of any of your favorite fillings: lightly mashed fresh fruit, vanilla pudding, mascarpone cheese, chocolate sauce. My son likes to put a fruit layer and a whipped cream or pudding layer in the center, then add the top half, and then top with a fruit layer and lots of whipped cream. *****You can also make a savory version of these shortcakes by omitting the sugar and vanilla, and adding parmesan cheese and a dash of garlic or onion powder. Top with olives, refried beans, sour cram, and salsa or greek salad. *****.\n",

      "In a large pot or very deep sauce pan, bring the milk (but not the buttermilk) up to the temperature of 175 F while occasionally stirring. Do this slowly on a low to medium heat to prevent burning. Once the milk has reached 175 F, turn off the heat and immediately stir in the buttermilk and lemon juice. You will notice the curds forming almost immediately. Allow approximately 10 to 15 minutes for all the curds to form. When the curds finish forming, scoop them into a colander lined with a double layer of cheese cloth. Create a pouch and hang the cheese so it can continue to strain. Hang the homemade cheese for 1 24 hours depending on the desired texture (it will be ready to eat in about an hour). After the cheese is done hanging, unwrap it, place it in a bowl, and mix in salt and pepper. This would also be the time to add other flavors such as herbs, garlic, or spices.\n",

      "In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, cream together the cream cheese, butter and sugar. Add the vanilla and mix to incorporate. Add the flour and salt and mix until everything is combined.

Take the dough out of the fridge about 45 minutes before youre ready to use it. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F and line a couple of baking sheets with parchment paper, set them aside. To make the filling, mix together the brown sugar, granulated sugar, walnuts and cinnamon, set aside. Add the apricot preserves in a microwave safe bowl and pop it in the microwave for a few seconds just to loosen it up a bit. Take each piece of dough, roll it out to a 9 circle on a well floured surface (if the dough cracks and breaks, gather it up, warm it with your hands and re-roll it) brush or spread some of the preserves over the surface of the dough and sprinkle some of the cinnamon sugar mixture over the top. Lightly press the sugar filling into the dough using your hands, cut the circle into 12 little triangles and starting from the wider end, roll them up like little crescents. Repeat this process with the remaining dough and filling. Place them seam side down on your baking sheet and brush the tops with some egg wash. Before you bake them, pop them in the fridge for about 15 minutes so the dough can firm up a bit. Bake them in your preheated oven for about 20 to 25 minutes or until golden brown.\n",

      "To measure, push the roughly chopped arugula into your measuring cup -- not too hard, but don't measure loosely. Put this in your processor. Add the rest of the ingredients, and whizz. I prefer a pesto which is not too smooth, but slightly \"granular\" still. NOTES: If you're using ready-washed arugula and parsley which are dry, you might want to add a tiny bit more oil. Mine usually has water on the leaves, which adds to the liquid available. You can toast the walnuts lightly. I prefer walnuts because they contain more oil than other nuts. The arugula should definitely be young -- the moment they start going to seed the leaves become very bitter. The pesto should stand, covered, in the fridge for a few hours or more, as the flavours then meld better. Delicious forked into hot al dente spaghetti, with extra, fresh parmesan shavings on top. Can be dropped into a mixed greens salad by teaspoonsful. I eat this on hot toast as well. (Ah well, takes all kinds to make a world -- ! ).\n",

With electric mixer at medium-high speed, beat butter and cream cheese in large bowl, stopping once or twice to scrape down beater and sides of bowl, until completely homogeneous, about 2 minutes. Add flour mixture and combine on medium-low until mixture resembles coarse cornmeal, about 20 seconds. Scrape down sides of bowl. Increase mixer speed to medium-high and beat until dough begins to form large clumps, about 30 seconds. Reserve 3 tablespoons of dough. Turn remaining dough onto lightly floured surface, gather into ball, and flatten into 6-inch disk. Transfer disk to greased pie plate. 3. Press dough evenly over bottom of pie plate toward sides, using heel of your hand. Hold plate up to light to ensure that dough is evenly distributed. With your fingertips, continue to work dough over bottom of plate and up sides until evenly distributed. 4. On floured surface, roll reserved dough into 12-inch rope. Divide into three pieces, roll each piece into 8-inch rope, and form fluted edge. Wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least 1 hour. 5. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325 degrees. Lightly prick bottom of crust with fork. Bake until golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool on wire rack. (If large bubbles form, wait until crust is fully baked, then gently press on bubbles with kitchen towel. Bubbles will settle as crust cools.)\n",

      "Optional- As mentioned above, I like a cream cheese version of this frosting best. The cream cheese adds to the creamy texture, and cuts down on the sweetness just a bit. If desired, for a very light cream cheese flavor add 1/2 block (4 oz). cream cheese, leaving the other ingredients (as listed above) the same. For a more traditional cream cheese flavor, reduce the butter to 1/2 cup, and add 1 block (8 oz.) of cream cheese. If using a full block of cream cheese, you can reduce the cream or milk to 1 tablespoon total. Flavoring options- An almost unlimited number of flavoring options can be added in addition to, or instead of the vanilla. Orange and/or lemon zest, citrus extracts, mint extract, coconut extract or the seeds of a vanilla bean are all wonderful options. In most cases Ill still add 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, then 1/2 teaspoon of the other flavoring. For zest, add about 1 teaspoon fresh zest. For chocolate buttercream, add 1/2 cup (good quality) unsweetened cocoa powder. Directions-. * In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment, beat butter (on medium speed) until completely smooth (30 seconds to a minute). (If you are adding cream cheese, add it now, then beat until smooth). * Add salt (if needed). * One cup at time, add 2 cups of powdered sugar, beating after each addition. * Add vanilla, or other flavorings and beat to combine. * Add about 1 tablespoon of cream, and continue beating. * Add the remaining 2 cups powdered sugar, one at a time. * Add an additional 1-2 tablespoons cream until desired consistency is reached. If you want to pipe the frosting on cupcakes, the frosting should be nice and thick. Continue to beat another minute or so. The frosting should now be smooth and fluffy. Troubleshooting-. * If your frosting is not smooth, it is likely because the butter was not fully smooth before adding the other ingredients. * If your frosting will not hold up when piped on cupcakes, your frosting has too much liquid or is too warm. Put entire bowl of frosting in the fridge for 15-20 minutes and it will stiffen up. If it is still too thin, then add 1/4 to 1/2 cup powdered sugar, beat well.\n",

      "In a large saucepan, over medium heat, combine the sugar, peach slices, cloves, and nutmeg. Mix until blended. Bring mixture to a boil; turn down heat and allow mixture to simmer until the peaches are softened, 20 to 25 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, remove the peaches from the saucepan and place in a small bowl. Reserve 1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons of the peach liquid in the saucepan and discard the rest. Return the peaches to the saucepan. In a small bowl, combine the lemon juice and the cornstarch. Whisk cornstarch mixture into the peach mixture, stirring until combined. Bring mixture to a boil and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly to keep from sticking; mixture will be very thick. Transfer peach mixture to a clean bowl and chill for 1 hour, or until completely chilled. To make crust: Sift together the flour, sugar, cinnamon and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the chilled cream cheese and shortening and, working with your hands or a fork, mix until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Add the cold water, 1 tablespoon at a time and gently mix until the dough begins to stick together. Form dough into a round disk, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Remove from the refrigerator and divide the dough into 8 equal portions. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each dough piece into a thin circle, about 6-inches in diameter. Place 1/4 cup of the chilled peach filling into the center of each dough round. Fold the dough over, making a half-moon shaped pastry, trim any excess dough leaving a 1/2-inch edge around the filling, and crimp the edges together with a fork. Chill pies for 30 minutes. In a large heavy skillet, melt vegetable shortening to a depth of about 1/2-inch. Heat the shortening to 350 degrees. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with paper towels and sprinkle sugar lightly over the paper towels. Fry pies in skillet, in batches, until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes on each side. Transfer to the paper towel-lined baking sheet and sprinkle the tops of the pies with sugar. Serve immediately with vanilla bean ice cream, or let cool on a wire rack and serve at room temperature.\n",

Mix the dough until it is slightly tacky and all ingredients are added in. Take the dough out of bowl and place onto a lightly floured surface and knead the dough until smooth but still tacky. Oil a large bowl with little oil and place dough in bowl making sure all surfaces are brushed with oil. Cover the bowl with a towel and set in a warm, draft-free place until it becomes almost twice it's original size. Should take from 1 hour to 1 1/2 hours. Divide dough in 2 equal portions and roll out or hand toss, your preference. Place on pizza sheets, I prefer the air bake pans. Add toppings and cheese, put a light layer of cheese over sauce but under other toppings to help hold pizza top together. Place in an oven set to 450F and cook around 20 minutes, more or less depending on preference and how done you like your pizza, enjoy!\n",

If you want whiter icing, try to use butter without dyes available at most health food stores. This recipe is for a stiff consistency. For a thinner consistency, use 3 pounds of powdered sugar instead. If you want a very smooth cake, let the cake sit for 15 minutes after icing (longer for a thinner icing). Then using your spatula or fondant smoothing tool (this works best) smooth it with the non-printed side of a Viva paper towel. To do this, take your paper towel and lay it on your icing (after it crusts) and lightly rub over the paper towel with your spatual or fondant smoothing tool to get a smooth surface. If the icing sticks to the paper towel, you didn't let it \"crust\" long enough. Stick it in the fridge for 20 minutes or so to let it \"crust\" then try again. Don't let it set too much tho then it will be difficult to smooth it. This recipe will ice, fill and decorate an 8\" double layer cake with icing left over.\n",

Mix the sliced apples with the cinnamon, sugar, and lemon juice, reserving a little sugar and cinnamon. Mix well. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one ball of pastry and use it to line a deep 10-inch pie dish. Bake the pastry blind (see note on baking blind). When the pie shell has cooled, fill it with the apples, piling them higher in the center. Roll out the other pastry ball thinly and gently lay it on top. Press the edges together, trim off any excess pastry, then mark the edges with a fork and prick the top of the pie several times. Mix the reserved cinnamon and sugar together, and sprinkle the mixture on top of the pie. Bake at 375 F for 35-40 minutes, until the topping is golden brown and the apples have cooked. Note: Baking Blind: Baking blind, which partially cooks the pie shell, will ensure that it stays crisp under a liquid filling. Cover the pastry, including the rim, with aluminum foil to prevent it from rising. Weigh it down with baking beans (dried lima or butter beans are perfect). Bake it in a preheated oven at 400 F for 10-12 minutes (slightly less time if you are making small individual pie shells). Remove the foil and bake for a further 5 minutes or until the pie shell starts to color.\n",

      "Add the ingredients into the bread machine in the order listed, and let the machine handle the dough until the first rising. After the first rising has ended, divide the dough into 8 equal portions and shape into balls, cover with a well-wrung out cloth, and let rest for 10 minutes. Shape the dough into balls again after it has rested. Lightly press down on the dough to deflate it. (You can press the dough on your palms.) Pinch the outside of the dough, and roll it back up. (Use the palm of your hand for this as well). Neaten up and line the rolled dough up on a cookie sheet. Cover with a well-wrung out cloth and let rise for the second time until 1.5~2 times the size. (The dough will rise rapidly in the summer, leave it to proof in a cool room). This photo shows the dough after it has risen for the second time. Take this time to preheat the oven to 180C. Lightly sprinkle the surface with bread flour, and cut a slit into the front with a knife that cuts well. Slash the tops of the rolls. Bake in an oven preheated to 180C for about 15 minutes, and it is done! These rolls have a milky, subtly sweet fragrance! Eat with pasta or stew. They're also delicious on their own! If you break the rolls apart like this after they've cooled down a bit and still warm, they're so fluffy and moist! I recommend this bread for kids with egg allergies.\n",

Then stir in the last 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips and mix together until all the chocolate is smooth and glossy. Drop a spoonful of the melted chocolate into 8 cupcake liners. Use a spoon to spread the chocolate into an even layer and bring the chocolate up the sides of the liners to help keep the filling in the cup. Put the chocolate cups in the fridge while you mix the filling. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with 1/4 cup of powdered sugar. Taste. If you want it a little sweeter, add some more powdered sugar and mix until there are no more lumps. Mix the Greek yogurt and orange zest into the cream cheese mixture. Once the chocolate cups have set, take them out of the fridge and drop a spoonful of the cream cheese filling into each one. Spread the filling into an even layer. Place the cups back in the fridge for about 5 minutes to let the cheesecake filling firm up a little bit. Take the cups out of the refrigerator, stir the rest of your melted chocolate (reheat for a few seconds if you need to), and drizzle the melted chocolate over the top of the cheesecake filling. Gently spread the chocolate over the filling, then put the cups back in the fridge for 5-10 minutes until the chocolate has hardened. Remove them from liners and serve.\n",

      "Combine all of the ingredients in a bowl except for the unsalted butter, bring it together into a ball and place it on a work surface to knead. Knead the butter into the dough. Press the dough down on the work surface and knead it for 5 minutes in a motion resembling washing with a wash board. Once the dough comes together, knead by pressing and pulling it in a \"V\" along your work surface while putting your weight into it. Seal the underside once the surface is no longer rough and the ingredients have combined evenly, and smooth out the surface. Place in a bowl and cover with plastic wrap. The first proofing is complete once it has doubled in size. (For those concerned about drying out the dough, place it into a plastic bag or Styrofoam container with a cup of lukewarm water and let it rise.) Divide into 6 equal portions with a scraper. Gently stretch out the dough to release the air, then roll each portion into a ball. Sprinkle with a bit of flour if they stick to your hands. Flip the bowl that you used for the proofing over top of the dough to prevent it from drying out, and let it rise for 20 minutes. Gently release more gas from the dough and roll them back into a round ball. Arrange them with the seams down on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Place the whole pan into a large plastic bag along with a cup of lukewarm water to prevent it from drying out, and let it rise for the second time. The second proofing is done once they double in size. Bake in an oven preheated to 190C for 14 minutes. (Adjust the heat according to your oven. They will bake more evenly on a round pan. They're done! They taste good as is, but you can also cut them in half and eat them with condensed milk cream. Or, as hamburger buns. I eat them with roast beef. Or bake them with an anko (sweet adzuki bean paste) filling. Layer the top with cookie dough for a \"melon\" bread. Or, without dividing up the dough, roll it into a flat square, spread on some cream cheese, roll it up into a log, then cut it into 6 pieces and bake. Knead in a few more grams of water, then add dried blueberries right before you complete the kneading, then let it rise. The berries will be nice and plump when you take that first bite. Here it is with a sweet peanut cream filling and topped with almonds. I baked it as a danish-type roll. Here they are baked topped with wieners, leftover curry, and melting cheese. Since the dough is not too sweet, it goes well with savory toppings. Here it is after cutting the dough in half and baking them in miniature pound cake molds with a sugared or buttered top. Right before baking, slash the tops with one shallow cut along the top, then arrange finely diced pats of butter along the top.\n",

      "Make the dough in the bread machine. Put everything in there according to the manufacturers instructions for your machine. If I have the time, I shred my own mozzarella cheese (about 2lbs). If not, I use the store bought shred- about 3 cups per pizza. Then, lucky me, I live 3 blocks from the place that makes homemade Italian sausage, I get a pound of the mild, loose sausage and fry it up just until the pink goes and some pieces are starting to brown. I also fry up the onions right in there with the sausage and they are also just starting to brown and are no longer crispy but are kinda wilted and softer. I use half an onion about the size of a baseball, sliced in 3/8 inch rounds. If youre doing other veggies, do them right in there with these. I cut the dough in half and make 2 pizzas rolled out to about 10x12 rectangles. I roll it out to about 1/4 to 3/8 inch- pretty thin, like cookie dough. It makes a thin crust pizza that is crispy on the bottom but doughy on the top like its supposed to be. Then I put the pizza together with the dough, a layer of cheese, a thick layer of sauce (use about 1 to 1 1/2 cups per pizza), the sausage and onion mixture or whatever toppings you're using, a heavy sprinkling of granulated garlic and then romano cheese, then another semi-thick layer of cheese. When I heat the oven up (425*), I put the pan or stone in the oven so when I put the pizza on it, its already hot. I roll my dough out with a rolling pin onto heavily floured parchment and use a cookie sheet with no sides to transfer the pizzas back and forth and I just drag them by the edges of the parchment. I take all the extra racks out of the oven and move the one Im using close to the bottom so theres room to work in there. Bake them 20 minutes. The tops should be very brown and look good enough to be in a magazine. When it comes out, the onions are perfectly carmelized and the sausage is not all burnt up or funky raw like when you throw it on top. It stays juicy and flavorful cause its baked it the sauce. Only pepperoni or little cooked meatballs goes on top. All other stuff gets fried lightly and baked in, under the final layer of cheese. *The hot pizza stone is a critical piece of the puzzle for achieving a perfect crust. Get one- they are sooo worth the money. If you dont have one, use a dark cookie tray- not one of those air-bake ones. They dont work well. Been there, done that. If you use a dark one, youll get very close to the perfect crust. Make sure you choose one that stays flat when it gets hot because some of them buckle up and twist when they get hot and then all your cheese and toppings will slide to the middle (oh, no!). I've been doing this a long time so I've made ALL the mistakes at least once! This is another one of those recipes Ive been refining for 15 or 20 years. This is as close to the perfect pizza Ive come.\n",

      "DOUGH: Combine flour, baking powder add salt in food processor. Process for 3 seconds. With motor running, slowly add cooking oil and enough warm water through feed chute until a ball begins to form. Turn dough out onto lightly floured surface. Knead 3 to 4 times until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap. Let stand for 20 minutes. ONION BUTTER: Saute onion in butter in small saucepan on medium-low for about 10 minutes until onion is soft but not brown. Keep hot. TWO CHEESE POTATO FILLING: Mix first 4 ingredients in medium bowl until Cheddar cheese melts and mixture is evenly moist. Makes about 2 1/4 cups filling. Divide dough into 4 equal portions. Roll out 1 portion into a rope about 12 inches long. Keep other portions covered. Cut at 1 inch intervals. Press balls slightly to flatten. Cover with plastic wrap. Stretch and press 1 ball to about 2 1/2 inches in diameter or roll out with rolling pin. Place in palm of hand. Place about 2 teaspoons filling centre. I like to make the potato filling a day ahead so that it is cold. Fold dough in half. With well floured fingers, pinch edges firmly together to seal. Edges of dough may be moistened if desired. Arrange in single layer on lightly floured tea towel-lined baking sheet. Cover with tea towel to prevent drying. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Cook varenyky, in batches, in boiling water and salt in large pot or Dutch oven for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally, until varenyky float to top. Allow to bob for 1 minute. Remove using slotted spoon. Drain. Turn into large bowl. Drizzle some Onion Butter over each varenyky batch. Gently shake to mix and prevent sticking. Makes 4 dozen varenyky. VARIATION: Add 6 bacon slices, cooked crisp and crumbled, to Two Cheese Potato Filling. VARIATION: After varenyky are cooked, saute, in batches, in 2 teaspoons butter in frying pan until lightly browned. TO MAKE AHEAD: Place filled varenyky (cooked or uncooked) on baking sheet, in layers between waxed paper or parchment paper. Cover. Freeze until solid. To remove varenyky, hit baking sheet on counter to pop them off. Store in resealable freezer bags in freezer. To cook from frozen, do not thaw. Boil, as above, increasing cooking time after they float to top. Serve with sour cream.\n",

Before leaving for work in the morning, toss the liner into the heating unit and don't forget to turn on Low. Brown meat and saute onions and garlic in oil as directed. While these are browning, prepare the vegetables and put in bottom of crockpot. Add the browned onion and garlic and then the meat (on top). Sprinkle seasonings over all. Pour the cider on, and cover and cook for 10 or 12 hours on Low, until meat and vegetables are tender. About 15 minutes before serving, check the amount of liquid in the stew. Quite a bit should have accumulated, but add some or all of the water to make as much sauce as desired.

      "Make the pastry. In a food processor, mix the flour, salt, and brown sugar. Add the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla and pulse just until the mixture begins to form a ball around the blades. Do not overprocess. Transfer the dough to a work surface and knead lightly and quickly into a smooth, compact roll. (Or prepare manually: In a large bowl, quickly mix together the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla until well blended. Gradually add the flour, salt, and sugar. Knead the mixture lightly until thoroughly combined and smooth. ). Divide the dough into 4 equal parts. Put each piece between two sheets of wax paper and flatten into a large oblong using the palm of your hand. If necessary, refrigerate briefly until the dough is firm enough to roll. Work with one oblong at a time, keeping the others refrigerated. Roll the oblong between the wax paper into a 12-by-7-inch rectangle, about 1/8 inch thick. Leaving the dough in the wax paper, refrigerate for at least 4 hours or up to 2 days. Repeat with the other 3 rectangles. Loosen the wax paper from both sides of the dough. (The paper becomes pressed into the dough with rolling and will be difficult to remove after you cut the dough unless it has been loosened first.) Place the dough rectangle back down on a sheet of the wax paper, and sprinkle it all over with 2 table-spoons brown sugar. Now cut the rectangle in half. You should have two 6-by-7-inch sections. Cut each section into 4 equal strips, giving you 8 in all. Leaving a 1/2 inch border, place some caramel pieces and pecans over each dough strip (be generousathe more caramels, the more luscious the taste). If your caramels are soft enough, press the pieces with your fingertips to flatten them. You'll get a smoother, tighter roll. Roll each strip up tightly, jelly-roll fashion, and place seam side down, about I inch apart, on a baking sheet lined with parchment. (If the dough becomes too soft to work with during the rolling or filling, place it on a lined cookie sheet in the freezer until firm again.) Refrigerate the prepared rugelach while you make rugelach with the rest of the dough. The prepared rugelach should be refrigerated for at least 30 minutes before you bake them. Preheat the oven to 375F Bake in the middle of the oven for about 20 minutes, or until pale golden. If necessary, adjust the pans during baking so the rugelach cook evenly. Transfer the pan to a rack and let the rugelach cool completely. Remove the rugelach carefully with a thin-bladed spatula. Store the rugelach in airtight containers for up to 4 days.\n",

      "For channa: Pour milk into a heavy 4-quart saucepan, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to medium and stir in buttermilk. When the curds form a mass (you'll see a clear, pale-yellow whey surrounding the curds), remove pan from heat, let stand, partially covered, for 10 minutes. Line a colander with a double layer of dampened cheesecloth. Set the colander in the sink or in a bowl if you wish to save the whey (see note). Gather together the corners of the cloth, give one or two twists, and tie with a kitchen twine. Gently pour the curds and whey into the cheesecloth. Hang the cheesecloth bag over the faucet and let the cheese drain for 1 hour, or until it is as thick as yogurt (this is channa). If the weather is warm, leave the cheesecloth bag in the colander, set the colander on a plate to catch the drippings, and refrigerate until the cheese has thickened. Unwrap the channa and use immediately, or cover and store in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. (Note: Save the whey for making your next batch of paneer, use it for cooking lentils or pilafs, or add it to soups.) Yields approximately 10 ounces. Nutrition Infomation: PER OUNCE (channa): 75 calories, 5 g protein, 0 g carbohydrate, 6 g fat (4 g saturated), cholesterol and sodium content is not available, 0 g fiber. For Paneer cheese: Snugly wrap cheesecloth around the channa to form a\"cake.\" Place on a cookie sheet, place another cookie sheet on top and add weights (for example, 2 or 3 large cans of tomatoes, 2 or 3 bricks, a large pitcher of water). Let the cheese sit for 2 to 4 hours.Use immediately, or cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Yields 8 ounces (1 cup).

Alternatively, cook the potatoes in a pressure cooker for 5 minutes, releasing the pressure immediately to prevent overcooking. Drain the potatoes and arrange them in a 6 x 9 x 2-inch casserole dish. In a large skillet, combine the beef and onion and cook together over medium heat until the beef is browned and the onion softened, 12 to 15 minutes. Pour off the excess fat. Preheat the oven to 350F. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan and whisk in the flour to make a roux. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until the mixture bubbles and the flour turns light brown in color. Gradually whisk in the milk and continue to stir while cooking over medium heat. When the mixture thickens, whisk in the salt and pepper, then stir in the cheese and browned beef. Pour the ground beef mixture over the potatoes and bake the casserole for 20 minutes until heated through and bubbling. Sprinkle the bread crumbs on top of the casserole and bake until the crumbs are toasted, about 5 minutes longer. Potatoes cook quickly. Test often for tenderness and dont overcook them. Because all the ingredients are fully cooked, if they are still hot when you assemble the casserole, the baking time can be greatly reduced or even eliminated; simply brown the crumb topping under the broiler for a couple of minutes.\n",

Helpful Hints You can make your own blanched almond flour for this recipe by grinding slivered almonds in a food processor or blender until it becomes a finely ground flour. If you prefer, you can grind the sesame seeds in a coffee grinder (maybe a blender or food processor). Just remember that the recipe calls for 2 tablespoons before grinding. Many cheese recipes call for nutritional yeast. I personally do not like nutritional yeast so did not include it in this recipe, but if you like nutritional yeast feel free to add some.\n",

With machine running, gradually add molasses and milk; process until dough is evenly moistened and forms soft mass, about 10 seconds. Alternatively, in bowl of standing mixer fitted with paddle attachment, stir together flour, sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, salt, and baking soda at low speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Stop mixer and add butter pieces; mix at medium-low speed until mixture is sandy and resembles fine meal, about 1 1/2 minutes. Reduce speed to low and, with mixer running, gradually add molasses and milk; mix until dough is evenly moistened, about 20 seconds. Increase speed to medium and mix until thoroughly combined, about 10 seconds. Scrape dough onto work surface; divide into quarters. Working with one portion of dough at a time, roll 1/8-inch thick between two large sheets of parchment paper. Leaving dough sandwiched between parchment layers, stack on cookie sheet and freeze until firm, 15 to 20 minutes. Alternatively, refrigerate dough 2 hours or overnight. Adjust oven racks to upper- and lower-middle positions and heat oven to 325 degrees. Line two cookie sheets with parchment paper. Remove one dough sheet from freezer; place on work surface. Peel off top parchment sheet and gently lay it back in place. Flip dough over; peel off and discard second parchment layer. Cut dough into 5-inch gingerbread people or 3-inch gingerbread cookies, transferring shapes to parchment-lined cookie sheets with wide metal spatula, spacing them 3/4 inch apart; set scraps aside. Repeat with remaining dough until cookie sheets are full. Bake cookies until slightly darkened and firm in centers when pressed with finger, about 15 to 20 minutes, rotating cookie sheets front to back and switching positions top to bottom halfway through baking time. Do not overbake. Cool cookies on sheets 2 minutes, then remove with wide metal spatula to wire rack; cool to room temperature. Gather scraps; repeat rolling, cutting, and baking in steps 2 and 4.

Put a baking dish on the bottom rack of the oven and add several ice cubes to create steam. Place the bread in the center of the oven and bake for 30 minutes. Then cover the loaves loosely with a sheet of foil and bake for an additional 15 minutes. Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and cool completely on a wire rack.\n",

Fold the wet ingredients in with a spatula. Dust a work surface with flour and roll the dough out until just over 1 cm thick. Fold the dough in half and press it down gently. Then use some cutters to cut out some shapes. Preheat the oven to 200C. Lightly brush the tops of the scones with milk and leave them to sit in a warm place for 15 minutes. Then bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes. The scones in the recipe photo have been served with clotted cream and strawberry jam.

Add Vital Wheat Gluten and combine as much as possible. Turn mixture out on a well floured surface and scrape any unincorporated ingredients from the bowl on top of the mixture. Knead 1/4 turn at a time with your palm until the mixture is no longer sticky and is very elastic-- this usually takes about 3-5 minutes and 1/2 cup flour. Note that the amount of additional flour required will depend on how much humidity your ingredients have absorbed-- You may need more or less than 1/2 cup. Put 1 Tbs of olive oil in your large bowl then swirl it around the bottom and half way up the sides. Put the dough in the bowl, then turn it over, cover and let it rise in a warm place. After it doubles, punch it down, turn it over, cover, and let it rise again. Cut the dough in half and place in freezer bags-- if using immediately, place half the dough on prepared pizza pan without punching it down so that it will be easier to spread out. To use frozen dough, let it thaw in the freezer bag then place in a bowl, cover, and allow it to rise in a warm place before placing on a pizza pan prepared with cooking spray. Since this dough is very elastic, I spread it out with my fingers as much as possible, then let it rise a little and spread it some more-- this seems easier than rolling it. Prick the dough with a fork to avoid bubbles, add your favorite sauce, pizza ingredients and cheese. Bake in a hot oven, 450F, until the cheese and the edge of the crust are lightly browned and cut the pizza into slices. Notes: The \"cooking\" time is an estimate of time for rising; The nutritional information is for one slice of pizza crust assuming that each pizza is sliced into 8 pieces.\n",

(If mixture does not bubble, either the liquid was not at the correct temperature or the yeast is old.) Combine flour and salt in a large bowl and whisk to aerate and break up any lumps. When yeast is ready, add flour and mix over lowest speed until dough just starts to come together and looks shredded, about 2 minutes. Increase speed to medium and continue to mix until dough is elastic and smooth, about 5 to 7 minutes. Gather dough into a ball, place in a large, oiled mixing bowl, and turn to coat. Cover with a clean, damp dishtowel, and let rest in a warm place until it doubles in size, about 30 to 40 minutes. Once the dough has risen, punch it down, then shape and bake it as desired.\n",

      "Butter or grease two loaf pans. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, salt, and pepper (if using); set aside. Stir the butter into the scalded milk; let cool to room temperature. Once the milk has cooled you can begin to make the dough by pouring the water into the bowl of your stand mixer. Whisk in yeast, wait a minute, then whisk again to be sure all the yeast is completely dissolved; whisk in the cooled milk and butter mixture. Stir in half the flour with a large rubber spatula, then stir in the remaining flour, in smaller batches, to ensure all the flour is moistened. Place the bowl on the stand mixer, fitted with the dough hook, and beat on medium speed until the dough gets smoother, but not competely smooth, about 2 minutes; let rest 10 minutes. Add the cheese and nuts then beat, on medium speed, until the dough becomes smoother and more elastic, about 2 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oil bowl to rise, turning to coat all sides with oil; drape oiled plastic wrap on top and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. Turn dough out on a lightly floured work area, turn over, press to deflate, then set aside (in oiled bowl) to rise again, about 1 hour. Turn dough out onto floured board and divide in half, taking care not to delate dough too much; shape each half into an 8 to 9 inch square. Roll dough tightly, jelly roll fashion, pinching the edge in when you get to the end; place loaf in pan, seam side down, pressing it into place so that the surface is fairly even. Cover with oiled plastic wrap and let rise another hour; once risen, the dough should protrude about 1 inch over the rim of the loaf pan. Set oven rack to the middle and heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Uncover loaves, and place in the center of the oven rack, short side toward each other, equal distance from each other and the sides of the oven. Bake until the bread is risen, and is deep golden and firm; the internal temperature should be more than 200 degrees F, about 45 minutes. Unmold each loaf and cool, on its side, on a rack (this prevents falling). You can brush the breads with melted butter if you like your crusts soft. Let cool completely before slicing with a sharp serrated knife. Store at room temperature, in a plastic bag, or freeze for longer storage.\n",

With the end of a wooden spoon (or something like that) make 6-8 holes in the rice all the way to the bottom of the pot (this will help rice steam evenly). Place lid on pot and let cook without peeking for 15 minutes. Check for browning at bottom edge of pan. If rice is not ready cook for another 10-15 minutes. If bottom of rice is lightly browned and rice is cooked turn rice out into a serving bowl and stir gently. If rice is brown but not completely cooked turn heat down to low and cook for another 5-10 minutes. If rice is cooked but not brown turn heat up to medium high and cook until bottom is browned.

At 180 degrees F, turn off the heat, and skim the curds from the whey using a finely slotted spoon, dropping the curds into the cheesecloth-lined colander. (Save the whey for another use, such as breadmaking.) Gather the cheesecloth around the curds and tie it with a 2-foot length of string. Gently squeeze to remove more, but not all, liquid from the cheese, and then hang over the sink or a bowl for 20 to 30 minutes to drain it a bit more. (I use the string to tie the bag to my faucet.) Remove the ricotta from the cheesecloth, spoon it into a container, and stir in the salt. Serve ASAP, preferably without refrigerating.\n",

With your fingers, make a well in the middle of the flour mixture, and pour the bacon drippings and buttermilk into the well. With just the tips of your fingers, stir lightly and quickly to just bring the dough together before the butter and lard melt. Dough will be sticky. Scrape dough out onto a floured surface, and gently pat the dough flat. Sprinkle the top of the dough with flour, and fold it in half; pat down, fold again, and repeat until you have folded the dough 4 or 5 times. With a rolling pin, roll the dough out to a square about 1 inch thick. Cut the biscuit dough into rounds with a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter or the floured edge of a drinking glass by pushing straight down (twisting the cutter will seal the edge and keep the biscuits from rising). Lay the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet so the edges just touch. Bake in the preheated oven until risen and lightly golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.\n",

Gradually add enough flour for the mixture to form a stiff dough. Turn dough out onto floured board and knead about 10 minutes, adding flour as needed (I use my KitchenAid mixer with a dough hook). Be careful not to add too much flour or the bread will be heavy. Place the kneaded dough in a large oiled bowl and turn dough over to coat with the oil. Cover the dough with a large cloth and set aside in warm place to rise until it is doubled in size. Punch dough down and turn out onto floured board. Divide into 5 portions, shape each into loaves, and place in greased 4 1/2 x 8 1/2 inch non-stick loaf pans (the dark pans brown the bread better than the shiny pans). Cover pans with a cloth and let rise until doubled. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for about 25 to 30 minutes. Remove bread from pans immediately and let cool on rack.

It is best to work with cold pieces of butter as they are easier to cut into the flour. Once butter and flour are mixed together thoroughly, combine with oats and brown sugar. Press half of the oat mixture over the bottom of a greased 8 x 8 square pan. Pack the layer down firmly with a fork. Next place entire date mixture on top of the base, for the second layer.

      "For the shells: Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats (double up sheets of paper if needed to fully cover the pan). Process almonds, powdered sugar and cinnamon in a food processor until blended into a fine powder. Sift mixture into a large mixing bowl and set aside. Combine egg whites and granulated sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with the whisk attachment. Whip egg whites and sugar until stiff peaks are reached. (My perfect time is 2 minutes on speed 4, then 2 minutes on speed 6 and then another 2-3 minutes on speed 8. When ready, they should stay put if you hold the bowl upside-down). Add the dry mixture into the egg whites. Using a spatula, smash dry ingredient into the egg whites, flattening the mixture (use about 5-10 quick strokes to release the air). Then fold mixture onto itself until it becomes shiny again (another 30-40 strokes). When you lift up the spatula, there should be solid, thick ribbons that run off (this whole process should take no more than about 50 strokes). Transfer the batter to a large piping bag (I like to use a #12 round icing tip, but its optional). Using circle guides or freehand, pipe 1 circles onto the prepared baking sheets, keeping them at least 1-2 apart to allow for spreading. Do this same method for the second baking sheet. Holding each end of the baking sheet, give it a good slam on the counter. Rotate the pan and give it another few slams to release any air bubbles that remain. Sprinkle the tops lightly with some cinnamon. Let the macarons sit out for 30 minutes to an hour before baking to form a dry shell on the tops which will prevent cracking. After the first 30 minutes, preheat the oven to 325 F. Bake each sheet, one at a time, for about 12 minutes (depending on size), rotating the pan once halfway through. Once theyre ready, carefully test one by attempting to lift it off the baking sheet. If the top half starts to come off from the feet, it could use a few more minutes. When done, remove the sheet from the oven and place it on a cooling rack, allowing the cookies to cool before removing them from the sheet. Repeat baking the second sheet. Once they are cooled, match up macarons in pairs that are about the same size, one face down and one face up. For the cream cheese filling: In a large bowl beat the cream cheese and butter on medium speed for 2 minutes with an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the powdered sugar, 1/2 cup at a time until combined (carefully incorporate). Add vanilla, cinnamon and salt and continue to beat on medium for another 1-2 minutes. (Add up to 1/2 cup more sugar if too thin). Spread or pipe a layer of filling on the cookie side that has the bottom facing up. Then sandwich the halves together, pushing the filling to the edges. Notes: If using parchment paper (as opposed to a silicone mat) using small magnets help keep the paper flat, just be sure to remove the magnets before baking. Do not attempt to use low fat or reduced fat cream cheese for this filling, it will be too runny. Vanilla extract can be substituted for the vanilla bean paste. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days (or freeze them for up to one month). Then allow them to come to room temperature before eating. Macarons are best eaten 24-48 hours after assembly.\n",

Add nuts and seeds to the food processor and pulse until coarsely chopped, to the consistency of granola, then add vanilla, cinnamon and salt and pulse briefly to incorporate these final ingredients. Transfer mixture onto two large parchment lined baking sheets. To make live granola, place in the oven on the lowest setting (usually 135 degrees) for 24 hours. For instant gratification, bake 45 minutes in the oven at 250 degrees; for this more decadent treat, I sometimes drizzle agave over the granola, or add shredded coconut, currants and other dried fruit.

Shape into a ball, brush over a little more oil, cover and leave to rise in a warm place until it doubles in size. This should take about an hour. Knead again on a floured surface and divide into six pieces, rolling each chunk into a ball. Leave to rise for 10 minutes. Preheat the oven to 240 C or 475 F. Meanwhile, roll the balls flat until they're only 3mm or 1/8 of an inch thick and about 17cm or 7 inches across. Place on greased baking sheets, cover with a tea towel and let rest for 30 minutes. Spray the dough with water and bake for two minutes. Check to make sure they haven't gone hard and if not, bake for a couple minutes more. You want them firm but not hard or brown. Remove from the oven and serve immediately with dips or as a wrap for all sorts of fillings. Great with kebabs! If you must serve them later, you can brush them lightly with oil and then reheat them by briefly heating them in a frying pan.\n",

You will need to work in batches based on how big your cutting board is. Cut rolled dough into small squares and gently lift squares using a knife. Place them on a silicone baking mat lined baking sheet. (If you dont have one of these, try using non-stick spray on a baking sheet. Report back and let us know how that works!) If youd like, you can press the edge of a fork in each cracker to create the classic Cheez-It design. Sprinkle crackers with extra salt. About 3 pinches should do, depending on how salty you like your crackers. Bake for 10 minutes or until firm and a golden color (some like them more brown than others).

      "Mix yeast and warm water in a large bowl and let sit for 10 minutes. During this time you should see bubbles appear in the water (perfectly normal). Once yeast and water have sat for 10 minutes, add the oil, salt, sugar and 1 cup of flour. Mix with a hand mixer for 2 minutes. After the 2 minutes, stir in the rest of the flour and mix with a large spoon until you can no longer mix by spoon and continue by hand kneading as you go. Once you have all flour completely mixed in, you should have a texture that is NOT sticky and not dry (if it IS sticky add more flour and if it IS dry, add a LITTLE more water until desired consistency is reached). Roll into a dough ball. Place in an oiled boil (must be oiled and not sprayed) and flip one time. Cover with a damp towel and place in warm environment (NOT HOT). What I do is preheat the oven to 170 and then immediately turn off while I'm mixing the dough - this leaves the oven at the perfect temperature to rise. Let rise for 1 hour OR until doubled in size. Remove towel and dough and place dough ona lightly floured surface. Knead the dough and roll out into a large rectangle (you MAY need to lightly flour your rolling pin as well). You will now roll the rectangle back up along the short side (if you roll along the long side it will not fit in your bread pan). Pinch seams together on bottom and on ends and place seem side down into a sprayed full-size loaf pan. Place a damp towel over the loaf pan and put it back into the oven to rise a second time (again no heat on) for 30 minutes. Remove from oven at about 24 minutes and let it rise the last 6 minutes on the counter while you preheat your oven to 370 degrees F. Place uncovered loaf pan into the oven and bake for 30-32 minutes.

In a separate container, place the warm water and add the oil first and then the honey, using the same measuring spoon, as the oil will keep the honey from sticking to the spoon. Stir the liquids together and stir them, then turn on the mixer with dough hook installed to low speed for 15 seconds. Then add the liquid mixture all at once and turn the mixer to its lowest speed for about a minute and a halfuntil ingredients are pretty well together and shut it off. Let it rest this way for 10 minutes. Turn the mixer to the second speed and let it run 3 minutes. Remove the dough hook and turn the dough onto a floured board or table. Knead 3 or 4 times to get the air bubbles out. Place it in an oiled bowl (you can put it back in the mixer bowl) and put it in a warm place, like your oven with a cloth draped over it for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, punch it down and turn it onto the floured surface and knead another three or four times. Form loaves and put into 2 loaf pans. Put them in the same warm place with a cloth draped over them and let them rise 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is the color you like. If you put a small pan of water on the rack below the bread, it will make the crust softer and chewier. Remove from pans and let cool at least 30 minutes on a wire rack. I usually brush the tops with olive oil because it softens the crust a bit and makes the loaves look nice. This bread has a wonderful flavor and keeps very well.\n",

You can make this not too sweet (with less sugar) and add a spoonful of rose-petal or quince jam to each serving. For balouza muhallabeya, a creamier, less firm version, use milk instead of water.

      "In a Vita-Mix or high speed blender, puree all the ingredients until completely smooth, stopping to scrape the sides as necessary. Transfer to bowls and chill form a firmer pudding, or eat it straightaway. Try this with raspberries and fresh mint, or chopped nuts. Serves 4. NOTE: The whole young coconuts generally come with the husks trimmed down, so they sit flat with a pointed top. To open these coconuts, a cleaver is your best bet. You can use a chefs knife, but if you do, make sure its an old, inexpensive one! Lay the coconut on its side, securing it so that it wont roll Try not to hold the fruit with your free hand while you make the first cut (in case you have particularly bad aim!). Holding the knife high, bring it down sharply near the top of the coconut. The knife should sink in about 1/3 of the way, breaking through the inner shell. Quickly set the coconut upright so as not to lose the water to the cutting board. If you didnt succeed in breaking the inner shell, rotate the shell and try the technique again. Drain the coconut of its water into a blender or bowl, then use the cleaver or knife to finish cutting off the top to get at the meat. The meat will range from very thin and very soft (sometimes even with a pale purplish hue in very young coconuts), to thicker and firmer. The firmer meat is best for recipes that call for noodles or pasta squares. Sometimes you have to open a few before you get one with nice firm meat, but the soft meat is perfectly good for sauces and smoothies, and coconut meat freezes beautifully, so all of it is good to use. The best way to get the firmer meat out is by using the back of a spoon to pry it from the sides of the coconut, then trim away any of the shell residue with a paring knife. Lay the pieces of coconut flat on a cutting board and slice into 1/6 inch strips for dishes that call for coconut noodles. The Raw TruthThe Art of Preparing Living Foods Jeremy A Safron\n",

Remove the dough from the machine after the first knead - approximately 20 to 30 min. 2. Place dough on a floured surface. Divide into 8 parts. Form balls, gently press thumb through center of ball and slowly stretch into bagel shape. 3. While bagels rise, bring three qts of water and one Tbsp. of sugar to a rapid boil in a large saucepan. Drop test dough (see hints below). 4. Using a slotted spoon, drop 2-3 bagels into rapidly boiling water. Boil on each side for 1/2 min. Remove and cold on rack 1 minute, brush with egg and sprinkle with sesame or possibly poppy seeds, if you like. 5. Bake at 400 on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal, till golden brown - approximately 15 min. ** Bagel Success Hints ** When forming the bagels, set aside two 1/4\" balls of dough. When the bagels have doubled in size, drop the test dough into boiling water. The dough should pop to the top right away. When this happens, it is time to boil the bagels. ** A quick spray of non-stick vegetable coating on the top of the bagel may be substituted for the egg wash. ** To make bagel sticks, cut bagel before rising and lay out in a straight line. Roll sticks in a combination of sesame and poppy seeds with a healthy pinch of garlic pwdr. Let sticks rise, boil, and bake as described in the above directions. ** To make bagel chips, slice leftover bagels horizontally into thin slices. Bruish with butter or possibly margarine on one side. Lay (butter side up) on an ungreased cookie sheet and bake at 325 for 12-15 min till golden and crisp.\n",

      "Stir the yeast, sugar and 1/4 cup warm water in a large bowl (or in the bowl of a stand mixer). Let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, the flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons rosemary, the fine salt and 3/4 cup warm water; stir with a wooden spoon (or with the dough hook if using a mixer) until a dough forms. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead, dusting lightly with flour if necessary, until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. (Or knead with the dough hook on medium-high speed, adding a little flour if the dough sticks to the bowl, about 8 minutes.) Brush a large bowl with olive oil. Add the dough, cover with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature until more than doubled, about 2 hours. Brush 2 baking sheets with olive oil. Generously flour a work surface; turn the dough out onto the flour and divide into 4 pieces. Working with one piece at a time, sprinkle some flour on the dough, then fold the top and bottom portions into the middle. Fold in the sides to make a free-form square. Use a spatula to turn the dough over, then tuck the corners under to form a ball. Place seam-side down on a prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough, putting 2 balls on each baking sheet. Let stand, uncovered, until more than doubled, about 2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Bake the loaves 10 minutes; brush with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle with the kosher salt and the remaining 1/2 tablespoon rosemary. Continue baking until golden brown, about 10 more minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool. Serve with olive oil seasoned with pepper. Photograph by Lisa Shin\n",

Add the lukewarm water (with the fresh yeast if using fresh yeast) and mix with your hands. You can also use a rubber spatula if you like. Bring it all together and knead in the center of the bowl or on a lightly dusted table or board. After about 5 minutes, it should not be sticky. It is ready when it's elastic. If it's rather sticky, add a bit of flour. Cover the bowl with a moistened and wrung out towel, cover with a plastic bag or plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 5~8 hours for the second rising. If you're in a hurry, chill for 2 hours. The dough should rise to about twice the size. The picture shows dough that has chilled for 5 hours. Coat your finger with flour and try pressing a hole into it. Divide into 2 equal pieces and roll into balls. Cover so that it doesn't dry out and let rest for 20 minutes. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible, heating your baking pan at the same time. I use a convection oven that goes up to 250C. Flatten the rested dough out on kitchen parchment paper. Press out to 30 cm diameter and top with the toppings. It will become a bit springier and puffier than your ear. Slide the pizza with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking pan from the preheated oven. It'll puff right up. It'll be done in 10 minutes. The pictured pizza is topped with tomato sauce, sliced mozzarella, and dried basil.\n",

In a small bowl, whisk together the honey, milk, and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and pulse on and off a few times or mix on low until the dough barely comes together. It will be very soft and sticky. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and pat the dough into a rectangle about 1 inch thick. Wrap in plastic and chill until firm, about 2 hours or overnight. To prepare the topping: In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon and set aside. Divide the dough in half and return one half to the refrigerator. Sift an even layer of flour onto the work surface and roll the dough into a long rectangle about 1/8 inch thick. The dough will be sticky, so flour as necessary. Trim the edges of the rectangle to 4 inches wide. Working with the shorter side of the rectangle parallel to the work surface, cut the strip every 4 1/2 inches to make 4 crackers. Gather the scraps together and set aside. Place the crackers on one or two parchment-lined baking sheets and sprinkle with topping. Chill until firm, about 30-45 minutes. Repeat with the second batch of dough. Adjust the oven rack to the upper and lower positions and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Gather the scraps together into a ball, chill until firm, and reroll. Dust the surface with more flour and roll out the dough to get about two or three more crackers. Mark a vertical line down the middle of each cracker, being careful not to cut through the dough. Using a toothpick or a skewar, prick the dough to form two dotted rows about 1/2 from each side of the middle dividing line. Bake for 25 minutes, until browned and slightly firm to the touch, rotating the baking sheets halfway through to ensure even baking.\n",

Once the liquids have reached about 180 degrees, you will start to see the curds and whey separate. Turn off the heat and let them do their thing. Using a mesh spoon, start removing the curds from the pot and placing them into your cheesecloth-lined colander. Continue this process until you have removed each precious curd from the pot and all that is left is the whey. Let the curds drain for about 25 minutes. Once the curds have drained in the colander, gather the ends of the cheese cloth to make a pouch of the curds. Hang it to dry for another 30 minutes. Dont squeeze the pouch ... I know its temping, but it will harden the curds. Once drained, remove the curds from the cheese cloth and season with salt.\n",

Add the remaining 8 tablespoons butter and pulse until it is in pea-size pieces. Drizzle in the vodka and 3 tablespoons cold water and pulse until the dough just comes together. Divide the dough between 2 sheets of plastic wrap; use the plastic to help form each half into a disk. Wrap tightly and refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour or overnight. (The dough can be frozen for up to 2 months; thaw at room temperature.) Make the filling: Peel the apples and slice 1/2 inch thick. Transfer to a bowl and toss with the sugar and lemon juice. Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 15 to 18 minutes. Add the flour, heavy cream, cinnamon and salt and stir until the juices thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool completely. (The filling can be made up to 2 days ahead; cover and refrigerate.) Roll out 1 disk of dough into a 13-inch round on a floured surface. Ease into a 9 1/2-inch deep-dish pie plate. Add the filling, mounding it in the center; dot with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Roll out the remaining disk of dough into a 12-inch round on a floured surface. Lay the dough over the filling and press the edges together. Fold the overhanging dough under itself and crimp the edge with your fingers. Brush with heavy cream and sprinkle with sugar. Cut a few slits in the top crust to let steam escape. Chill at least 1 hour. Set a baking sheet on a rack in the lower third of the oven; preheat to 425 degrees F. Set the pie on the hot baking sheet and reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees F; bake until golden, 1 hour to 1 hour 10 minutes, rotating the pie as needed for even browning. (Cover the edge with foil if it is browning too quickly.) Transfer to a rack and let cool until set, about 3 hours. Photograph by Johnny Miller\n",

NOT TOO BIG. Wait 20 min. A must. Dough will stretch easily. While dough is resting prepare apples, peeled, sliced and dipped in salted water. Don't LET DOUGH STAND TOO LONG Or possibly IT WILL DRY AND CRACK WHEN ROLLED. After the 20 min stretch dough to paper thinness, brush with melted butter, sprinkle with some bread crumbs and sugar over entire stretched dough. Along one side of dough (lengthwise) place sliced apples inward to about 6\" and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon over the apples. Splash with melted butter and roll using the cloth to roll up. Place on a greased sheet in \"S\" shape or possibly horseshoe. Cut top with gashes for steam to avoid sogginess. Brush melted butter and bake at 375 degrees for 50 min or possibly till golden. With second ball of dough, roll out as for pie. Wait 20 min and continue as for first roll. Makes 2 large rolls. NOTE: 1/2 recipe may be halved to make two smaller strudels, one to bake and one to freeze. Sugar: Depends on sweetness of apples. Apples: 8 to 10 depending on size of apples and size of roll.\n",

      "Whisk together the flour, cheese powder, yeast, salt, and baking powder. If you're using baker's ammonia in place of baking powder, set it aside. Add the shortening, working it in to make an unevenly crumbly mixture. If you're using baker's ammonia, dissolve it in a tablespoon of the ice water, and sprinkle it over the dry mixture before adding the remaining ice water. Whether you're using baking powder or baker's ammonia, stir and toss in enough of the ice water to make a cohesive (but not sticky) dough. Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a small rectangular slab. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 30 minutes, or up to a couple of hours; don't chill longer than that. Preheat the oven to 400F. Very lightly flour a piece of parchment, your rolling pin, and the top of the dough. Working with one piece at a time, roll the dough about 1/16\" thick, or slightly thicker. If you don't have parchment, roll on a lightly floured work surface or silicone rolling mat. The dough will have ragged, uneven edges; that's OK. Just try to make it as even as possible. If you've used parchment, gently slide the parchment and crackers onto a baking sheet. Cut the dough into 1 1/4\" squares; a rolling pizza wheel works well here. Don't separate the squares. If you haven't used parchment, gently fold the rolled dough in half, pick it up, and place it on a lightly greased cookie sheet, THEN cut it. Prick each square with the tines of a fork. Bake the crackers for about 8 minutes, till the ones on the outside are starting to brown around the edges. Remove them from the oven, and transfer the browned crackers to a cooling rack or piece of parchment; they're done. Quickly and carefully pull the remaining crackers apart to separate them. Return to the oven. Bake for an additional 3 minutes or so, or until the remaining crackers are a very light golden brown. You'll need to watch these closely at the end; don't walk away from the oven. They go from golden to dark brown very quickly. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan. When completely cool, store in an airtight container.\n",

Sprinkle the sugar mixture and lemon juice over the apples. Stir the mixture to combine the ingredients, spreading them in an even layer in the baking dish. Set aside. Put the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl and use a large spoon to stir them together. Add the butter pieces, stirring to coat them with the flour. Rub the butter pieces and flour between your thumb and fingertips or cut them together with a pastry blender until coarse crumbs form that are about 1/2 to 3/4 inch in size, there is no loose flour, and the mixture looks pale yellow rather than white. Spread the crumbs evenly over the apple mixture. Bake about 40 minutes until the crumb topping is golden but with a few spots of light brown, and the apples are tender when tested with a toothpick. Let the crumble cool about 15 minutes before serving. Spoon the warm crumble onto individual plates and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, if desired. The crumble can be baked a day ahead, cooled, covered, and stored at room temperature. Warm it, uncovered, in a preheated 250F oven for 15 minutes.\n",

      "1. To Make Sponge: In a small bowl stir together 1/8 teaspoon of the yeast and the warm water and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy. In a bowl stir together yeast mixture, 1/3 cup of the water, and 1cup of the bread flour. Stir 4 minutes, then over bowl with plastic wrap. Let sponge stand at cool room temperature for at least 12 hours and up to 1 day. 2. To Make Bread: In a small bowl stir together yeast and milk and let stand 5 minutes, or until creamy. In bowl of a standing electric mixer fitted with dough hook blend together milk mixture, sponge, water, oil, and flour at low speed until flour is just moistened; add salt and mix until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes. Scrape dough into an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 3. Let dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. (Dough will be sticky and full of air bubbles.) Turn dough out onto a well-floured work surface and cut in half. Transfer each half to a parchment sheet and form into an irregular oval about 9 inches long. Dimple loaves with floured fingers and dust tops with flour. Cover loaves with a dampened kitchen towel. Let loaves rise at room temperature until almost doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. 4. At least 45 minutes before baking ciabatta, put a baking stone on oven rack in lowest position in oven and preheat oven to 425*F. (220*C). 5. Transfer 1 loaf on its parchment to a rimless baking sheet with a long side of loaf parallel to far edge of baking sheet. Line up far edge of baking sheet with far edge of stone or tiles, and tilt baking sheet to slide loaf with parchment onto back half of stone or tiles. Transfer remaining loaf to front half of stone in a similar manner. Bake ciabatta loaves 20 minutes, or until pale golden. Cool loaves on a wire rack. My Note: * The second time I made the sponge I left it right next to a warm stove top and it rose very quickly and made these HUGE air pockets in my finished product. I only left this for 4 hours but the taste and texture were FANTASTIC and the sponge almost spilled over the rim of the bowl! It was a bit difficult to get out of the bowl because of its stickiness but that was to be expected. For those that thought the sponge needed water, it doesn't. It will look just like a clump of dough in the beginning but if you leave it you'll be pleasantly surprised with a bubbling, frothy, sticky sponge. Secondly, I made this recipe cautiously because I expected it to be very difficult to handle, but it was not. I prepared the sponge two days in advance and kept it in the fridge. I had no problems with it being too sticky. I cooked it on a pizza stone and basted with water every 5 minutes for a brown, crunchy crust. The parchment did burn a little around the edges while baking, but it was reminiscent of an old Italian bakery. The easiest 'real sourdough' recipe; those without 'aging' of dough lack the genuine ciabatta taste, even though they may get the consistancy right. This one gets even better with more than one days aging of the 'sponge'. I have fallen in love with making bread these past few months, and this is the best recipe I have have did, by far. I have made at least 12 loaves with this, and every time I make it, my friends devour it instantly. I have modified it a little, though. I found the original recipe to be too dry for my tastes when it came out of the over, so I tripled the olive oil, and it came out moist and delicious. Add more oil to the recipe and you're in great shape. I love this bread! It was a little involved as far as prep time but it was easy, GOOD, and tasted just like what we had eaten in Florence! I will make it again. For 15 people I made 6 loaves with enough left over for dinner the next night.\n",

      "In a 10\" bowl or bigger add the 2 1/4 cups of flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar and blend or mix well with a fork and set it to the side -- we will call this the dry mix -- In a smaller pre-warmed bowl mix the 3/4 cups of warm water, the 1/4 oz. packet of yeast, 2 teaspoons of white granulated sugar and the 1 teaspoon of salt. Now stir the wet mix well and let it set for 8 - 10 minutes to allow the yeast to start activating -- If it grows a head of foam a beer could only dream of in that time, you did it correctly. After waiting the 8 - 10 minutes mentioned above, combine the 2 mixes (Wet and Dry), and blend just until the bread quits sticking to the bowl and stop mixing -- The dough should look stringy and not be completely blended together. At this time dump the dough onto a clean, dry and lightly floured work area. Wash your hands as you wash the 10\" bowl that you will need again in a moment -- dry the bowl and flour your hands. At this time add 4 tablespoons of the olive oil -- yes just pour it on top of the dough and kneed the bread until a nice doughball is formed -- Most of the kneeding is done at this time so mash and fold -- mash and fold.alot. After a nice doughball is formed, oil the 10\" bowl with 1/2 the remaining olive oil and place the doughball in the bowl flipping the dough until it is coated well with the oil -- (This keeps the the dough from stiffening up while it is rising.) Cover the bowl and place in a warm spot to rise until doubled in size -- (on a warm day it should take roughly an hour, on a cold and rainy day it may take up to 3 hours). After the dough has doubled in size dump the dough onto your lightly floured surface then kneed and double fold the dough 4 times and stop kneeding . Reform and oil the ball with the last remaining tablespoon of olive oil and place back into the bowl and allow the dough to rise again until it has doubled in size a second time. After it has risen the second time punch down the dough and dump the doughball back onto your lightly floured work surface and sprinkle the doughball lightly with flour and roll out the dough to roughly form a 10\" to 12\" square -- On this square pour the melted butter and spread evenly to cover the top of the dough square. Now lightly cover the buttered area with a light coating of cinnamon and the left over brown sugar. Now add the pecan pieces on top of the brown sugar if you so choose. Now roll the dough into a log and take a serrated bread knife and CUT the dough into 1\" wide sections -- (DO NOT just mash through the dough with the knife) -- Now place the rounds on a non-stick or pam coated baking pan and allow them to rise again -- basically until they have doubled in size again. Preheat and bake in a 350* oven for 10-12 minutes or until nice and brown. glaze and enjoy.\n",

Bring to boil, then lower heat to simmer. Add in sugar and sour salt Or possibly lemon juice Or possibly vinegar. Cook till meat is tender. Taste it and adjust for sweet and sour to your family's liking. Add in more sugar if not sweet sufficient, more sour if too sweet. The first taste should almost make your mouth pucker. Remove meat. Add in sliced cabbage and potatoes, and bring soup back to boil, lower head again and cook till potatoes and cabbage are tender, around 25 min. You can serve this in either of two ways: (1) slice meat and remove potatoes from with slotted spoon. Serve the meat and potatoes on serving platters at the table. (2) Slice or possibly chunk meat and return to pot and serve up as a one dish meal. This is really yummy with a good dark pumpernickel bread. *Note. since this is a peasant type soup, the measurements do not need to be exact.

Let it rest this way for 10 minutes. Turn the mixer to the second speed and let it run 3 minutes. Remove the dough hook and turn the dough onto a floured board or table. Knead 3 or 4 times to get the air bubbles out. Place it in an oiled bowl (you can put it back in the mixer bowl) and put it in a warm place, like your oven with a cloth draped over it for 1 hour. At the end of the hour, punch it down and turn it onto the floured surface and knead another three or four times. Form loaves and put into 2 loaf pans. Put them in the same warm place with a cloth draped over them and let them rise 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until crust is the color you like. If you put a small pan of water on the rack below the bread, it will make the crust softer and chewier. Remove from pans and let cool at least 30 minutes on a wire rack.

Meanwhile, warm the honey up to make it runny by placing the container in hot water for a few minutes. In a separate container combine the flax seed and water and mix until they make a gloopy paste similar to the texture of beaten egg whites. If you don't have ground flax seeds you can blitz whole seeds with water in a blender or food processor to achieve the same effect. Once the honey is fluid pour it over the cereal along with the oil and flax mixture and stir to combine. Using your hand is the easiest way. It's messy but it ensures you don't crush the cereal too much. Crumble the mixture in even layers on the baking sheets and place in the warm over until toasty and brown, which usually takes no more than 10 minutes. You can usually tell it's done when you can smell toasted nuts and grains. Keep an eye on it because it can easily burn. Remove and let cool on the sheets, then transfer to storage containers.\n",

Divide dough into 8 pieces and wrap separately in plastic wrap. Line each of 2 trays with a dry kitchen towel and dust you hands with some semolina mixture. Remove plastic wrap from 1 piece of dough and roll between you hands to create a rope 3 to 4 feet long and 1/2 inch wide. Put rope on a work surface and with a sharp knife cut into 1/2-inch pieces, separating pieces as cut so they are no longer touching. Lightly toss cut pieces with a little semolina mixture. Put each cut piece of dough, a cut side down, in palm of hand and form a depression by pressing thumb of other hand into dough and twisting slightly. Arrange orecchiette on a kitchen-towel-lined tray. Make more orecchiette with remaining 7 pieces of dough in same manner, transferring to kitchen-towel-lined trays. Orecchiette may be made 2 days ahead and chilled on towel-lined trays, covered with plastic wrap.\n",

Mix hazelnuts with oats in a small container. Mix 2 teaspoons of reserved juice and maple syrup and heat in a microwave proof container (about 20 seconds at 50% heat in a 900 Watt microwave) - the original recipe suggested heating in a small pan, my suggestion if you do not have a microwave is put the maple syrup and juice in a heat proof container and heat in a water bath on top of the stove. Add the syrup/juice mixture to the oat and hazelnuts and mix well and then divide this mix over the peaches. Put into the oven and cook for 20 to 25 minutes until crispy and brown. Heat up 1/4 cup of reserved juice (again I suggest the microwave - 20 seconds in 900 watt microwave) or place juice in heatproof container and heat in a water bath on stove top.

      "For the Biga: dissolve the yeast in the water then mix with the flour until all the flour is absorbed. Cover and leave in a cool place overnight. Longer fermentation will give a more complex flavour and add a little acidity to the bread. In this case you can refrigerate the biga and leave it for up to 72 hours. For the dough: this bread requires a hot oven but the long bread making process will give you plenty of opportunity to build your fire. The ideal oven will be at 230C/450F falling slowly. Build up the fire until the oven is at an even 230C/450F which will take about 60 minutes. When it is up to temperature, push the fire to the back of the oven with your metal peel or coal hook. Keep the door shut to keep the heat in the oven. Mix together the water with the malt extract, one third of the olive oil and the yeast. Mix the salt with the flour then add this to the biga along with the liquid. Mix together with your hands until you have a soft, sticky dough. Don't panic at the stickiness of the dough at this stage. Knead the sticky dough on a clean surface, resisting the temptation to add more flour, until it is silky, smooth and springy. You may get messy to start with but stay with it. Tip the remaining olive oil on to a lipped tray and rub it so that the tray is coated. Place the kneaded dough on to the tray. Cover with clingfilm and leave for 1 hour in a warm place. Pat the dough out into a rectangle in the oiled tray and fold it over in thirds giving a little stretch in each direction. Flip the dough over so that the seam faces downwards. This stretching and folding helps to create an open texture in the bread and incorporates more oil. Cover again and then repeat this patting out and folding every 30-40 minutes another 3 times. Each time you are gently stretching and folding the dough rather than knocking out the gas. The dough will become huge. Cut the dough into three equal pieces taking care not to lose too much gas in the process. Dimple the surface with your fingertips to gently flatten and expand the breads, each should measure about 30x20cm/12x8\". Cover the dough and leave for another 15 minutes. Drizzle with a little more olive oil and sprinkle coarse sea salt over the surface then make deep impressions with your fingertips. At this stage you can add any other toppings but keep it simple eg rosemary, sage, pitted olives or sesame seeds are all traditional toppings. Open the oven door and use your well-floured wooden peel to place the dough directly on to the floor of the oven. Shut the door and bake for 12-18 minutes or until the upper surface is a deep golden brown. Open the oven door and use your wooden peel to take the loaves out and leave them to cook on a wire rack. This is delicious served with a fish soup and salad or with roast chicken, roast summer veggies and rocket salad.\n",

      "In the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer use the paddle attachment to combine the water and oil. In another bowl, mix the flour, cornmeal, salt (not the coarse salt), and red pepper flakes. Turn the machine onto low and pour in flour mixture. Blend just until the dough comes together. By hand- mix flour, cornmeal, salt and pepper flakes in a large bowl. Mix oil and water in a separate medium bowl. Make a well in the flour mixture and pour oil/water into the center. Mix with a wooden spoon until just combined, as with muffins. (This may require some hand-kneading to combine thoroughly) On a lightly floured surface, pat dough into a flat rectangle. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30-60 minutes. Preheat oven to 500F. If using baking stone (preferred method) place stone in oven about 45 minutes before baking to heat. Place the rack in the center of the oven. Line 2 large baking sheets with parchment. Remove from refrigerator and dough into 2 equal pieces. On a lightly floured surface roll dough into a 16x12 inch rectangle. (If dough \"resists and retracts\" let is rest and work with the other piece of dough) Transfer your rectangles to your baking sheet by lightly rolling them around your rolling pin then spreading them on the baking sheets. Poke each rectangle all over with a fork. If you would like consistent shapes, score lightly with a sharp knife. Mist with water and sprinkle with the course salt. Bake for about 10 minutes until dough is set- one sheet at a time. Transfer on the paper onto a rack to cool. Let cool completely, then break into irregularly shaped crackers or break at score marks. Store into an airtight container for up to 3 days.\n",

      "Arepas are simple corn cakes first made by the Indians of Colombia and Venezuela. They were an important part of their diet, like corn tortillas were to the Aztecs. Over the centuries, the poor people of Colombia and Venezuela continued to use them as inexpensive, easy-to-prepare source of nourishment. Today, these humble corn cakes are a comfort food for the rich and poor alike, a heart-warming tribute to simplicity, tradition, versatility, and good taste. Originally, arepas were made from dry corn kernels which were soaked overnight in water and lime to remove the skins, then cooked, liquid removed and grnd into masa (dough). Thanks to modern technology, a pre-cooked harina de masa is now available at most Latin American markets. An instant masa can be made by simply mixing this corn flour (either white or possibly yellow) with a little salt and sufficient boiling water to make a stiff dough. The dough is then shaped into flat round cakes of varying thicknesses, depending on the intended use, and cooked on a griddle or possibly deep-fried. In parts of Colombia, arepas are cooked atop a flagstone slab which is first heated and then brushed with fat. Another Colombian specialty - arepas de chocolo - are made from fresh corn and cooked on top of banana leaves. Colombian arepas are generally thinner than their Venezuelan counterparts. The standard Venezuelan arepa looks somewhat like a flat bread roll, crispy on the outside and doughy on the inside. They can be split open and buttered, or possibly spread with cream cheese or possibly fresh goat cheese. Made this way, they are served for breakfast or possibly as an accompaniment for grilled fowl, fish, meat stews, or possibly sausages. In Venezuela, the doughy inside is sometimes scooped out, and the shell is filled with savory mixtures of grnd or possibly minced pork, beef, ham, chicken, seafood, vegetables, or possibly beans. They are excellent first courses. Venezuelan mandocas, for example, are cheese arepas shaped into rings and deep-fried. Another specialty is bollos pelones - balls of arepa dough stuffed with seasoned grnd meat, either fried or possibly poached in water, then served with tomato sauce. A popular snack in Colombia consists of arepas served with fresh cheese and fried chorizo (sausage). Colombians also make tasty soups using fresh masa or possibly leftover arepas. Arepitas dulces make great desserts. The versatile arepa indeed proves which unpretentioius food can be not only satisfying but also delicious. Directions:In a large mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add in water, stir with a wooden spoon to make a soft dough. Let stand for 5 min, then knead for 3 min. Dough is ready to be shaped into standard arepas, or possibly to be mixed and kneaded with other ingredients such as cheese, chicharrones (pork rind), etc. To shape arepas: The standard Venezuelan arepa is 3 inches in diameter, 3/4 inch thick. Columbian arepas are larger and thinner, about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 inch thick. To make arepas, oil or possibly wet hands lightly and shape dough into balls. Place between 2 pcs of wax paper or possibly plastic wrap and flatten into a circle; shape the edges to create a smooth disc. To cook arepas: Heat a griddle or possibly cast iron skillet over medium heat; grease lightly and cook arepas on both sides, turning a couple of times till a crust is formed. Colombian arepas are ready to be served at this point, spread with butter. Venezuelan arepas have to be baked in a preheate 350-degree oven for 15 min. To check for doneness, tap the arepa lightly - if a hollow sound is heard, it's ready. Split open, add in butter and serve warm. Arepas freeze well if frzn while still hot. Freeze in layers separated by plastic wrap. Reheat frzn arepas wrapped in aluminum foil in a preheated 350-degree oven for 10 min or possibly till heared through.\n",

      "Mix the cornstarch and ground rice with about 1/2 cup cold milk and beat well, making sure that you break up any small lumps. Bring the rest of the milk to the boil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan. Add the cornstarch and ground rice mixture, stirring vigorously with a wooden spoon. Keep over low heat, and stir constantly, until you feel a slight resistance. Continue to cook gently over low heat for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the cream thickens further, stirring occasionally. Be very careful not to scrape the bottom of the pan; the cream burns slightly at the bottom, and if it is scraped it will give a burnt taste to the pudding. Add the sugar toward the end. Stir in the orange blossom water and 1 tablespoon rose water, and cook a few moments more. Let the cream cool a little before pouring into a glass serving bowl. Let it cool, then chill in the refrigerator, covered with plastic wrap. When the pudding is cold, prepare a honey syrup in a small pan by bringing to the boil the honey with about 1/2 cup water. Stir well and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of rose water. Let it cool and pour over the cold, firmed cream; it will seep in a little. Serve sprinkled with a pattern of chopped almonds and pistachios. Instead of garnishing with chopped nuts, serve topped with rose petal jam, which is available from Middle Eastern stores.\n",

Cut in margarine till mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Combine egg and coconut milk in a small bowl. Then add it into the flour mixture and stir until just moistened. Spread into prepared baking pan, building up the edge slightly. Bake for 15-18 minutes or until a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove pan from oven and set it on a rack. Cool shortcake in the pan for 10 minutes. Remove cake from pan onto your serving platter. Set it right side up and use a long serrated knife to cut it in half horizontally and split into 2 layers. Spoon half the coconut whipped cream (recipe below) onto bottom layer of the cake, top coconut cream with half the strawberries. Place top layer of cake onto strawberries and top the cake with remaining whipped cream and strawberries. To make whipped cream: With roughly 24 hours prior to making, place a full fat can of coconut cream in the refrigerator. Do not open or shake. When ready to use, scoop out the coconut meat and place it in a large bowl. Add stevia and vanilla extract. Beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.

Using a paring knife, cut a circle around the top/stem of the strawberry and scoop out the middle. I also cut a sliver off the bottom of each berry, so they would stand up on the platter. Just dont cut all the way through! Place the cheesecake filling in a piping bag and squeeze it to fill up the holes in the tops of the berries. Set the filled berries on a platter. Sprinkle graham cracker crumbs on top and serve! Tip: You should be fine to hollow out your strawberries ahead of time (I did it a few days prior). However, I wouldnt suggest filling them more than about 5 hours ahead of time (unless youre planning on freezing them). Otherwise they could get a little soggy.\n",

Add the butter. Working quickly, rub it between your fingertips until half is coarsely blended and remaining pieces are 3/4\" thick. Make a well in the center of the flour. Add all the buttermilk and stir mixture QUICKLY, just until it has blended and a sticky dough forms. (Add 1-2 tbsp.more buttermilk if dough appears too dry. ). Immediately turn the dough onto a floured surface. Using floured hands, briskly knead about 10 times until a ball forms. Gently flatten the dough, and using a flouring rolling pin, roll to 3/4\" thick. Prick dough with flour dipped fork at 1/2 \" intervals. Flour a 2-3\" biscuit cutter and stamp out rounds. Arrange on a heavy, parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake only until golden--10-12 minutes. Remove and brush with the melted butter. Serve hot. NOTE: Great for breaksfast right out of the oven with butter and honey. We eat biscuit leftovers reheated and cracked in half with a creamed vegetable/chicken mixture. (Tastes like mini potpies).\n",

      "Stir together: 2 teaspoons dry yeast, 1/2 cup lukewarm water. Add and mix well: 1/4 cup unbleached white flour, 1/4 cup rye flour. Allow this mixture to sit until quite bubbly, about 30 minutes. Mix together in another bowl: 3 1/4 cups unbleached white flour, 1 teaspoon salt. Stir this into the yeast and flour mixture with: 3/4 cup cold water, 1/4 cup olive oil. Mix thoroughly by hand or in an electric stand mixer. If working by hand, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead until the dough is soft and elastic, about 5 minutes. If the dough is too wet and sticky, add more flour, but only enough to form a soft, slightly sticky dough. Or use the mixer, fitted with the dough hook, and knead for about 5 minutes. The dough is the right texture when it pulls away from the sides of the bowl of the mixer, but still adheres to the bottom. A very soft, slightly moist dough will make the best focaccia. Put the dough in a large bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. For an even better-tasting and more supple dough, let the dough rise slowly overnight in the refrigerator. (Remove from the refrigerator 2 hours before shaping.) Generously oil a 10-inch by 15 1/2-inch rimmed baking or sheet pan. Gently remove the dough from the bowl and flatten it on the baking pan, shaping it to fit the pan by gently pressing down from the center out towards the edges. If the dough starts to resist and spring back, let it rest for 10 minutes, then continue shaping. Try not to deflate or smash all of the air out of the dough as you are shaping it. Dimple the surface of the dough by lightly poking it with your fingertips. Drizzle with: 2 tablespoons olive oil. Cover and let rise until doubled in height, about 2 hours. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 450F. If you have one, place a baking stone on the lower rack and let it heat for 30 minutes before baking the bread. Sprinkle the dough with: 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt and put the baking pan directly on the stone. Bake the focaccia until golden and crisp on the top and bottom, about 20 to 25 minutes. Invert the pan to remove the bread and place on a rack to cool. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary or sage leaves over the dough before baking. Chop about 1 tablespoon fresh tender herbs and add to the dough with the oil. Divide the dough in two before shaping and press into two 1/2-inch-thick disks. Put the disks into oiled 8-inch pie plates. Dimple, oil, let rise as above, and bake, checking after 10 minutes. Top with sauteed onions, cheese, tomato slices, or sauteed greens before baking.\n",

Cut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender or two knives, until the butter is the size of small peas. Stir in the grated cheese. Add the milk, and stir just until barely incorporated, dont over-mix. Allow the mixture to rest for about 10 minutes. 3. Drop the batter onto the sheet pans into mounds a little smaller than a golf ball; I used a 1-5/8 ounce scoop, leaving a couple of inches between each biscuit. Bake in the oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until the tops of the biscuits are deep golden brown. These are best served warm. Notes: 1. All-purpose flour gives a lighter texture to the biscuits, but if you would like to use only whole wheat flour, then increase the amount of milk by 1/4 cup. 2. To reheat leftover biscuits, brush them with a bit of melted butter and warm them in a 275 degrees F oven for 5 to 8 minutes.\n",

Combine the sugar, pistachios, and remaining 1 tablespoon rose water in a food processor and pulse until the mixture has the consistency of coarse sand. Add the pistachio mixture to the flour mixture, and using your hands, mix them together, breaking up the lumps until the mixture feels like damp sand. Line a 9-inch springform cake pan with wax paper, using two pieces crossing at right angles and allowing lengths of paper to hang over the sides of the pan. Spoon half of the semolina mixture into the pan and smooth it out to the edges with the back of the spoon. Follow with all of the kashta, spreading it over the semolina in an even layer. Spoon the remaining semolina mixture on top and spread it out in an even layer. Fold the overhanging wax paper over the top, and press to smooth the semolina. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Pour the olive oil into a skillet that is large enough to accommodate the nuts in a single layer. Heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the nuts, reduce the heat to low, and stir actively until they begin to darken slightly, about 1 minute (see Tips, below). Remove the pan from the heat, and use a slotted spoon to transfer the nuts to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. (Alternatively, dump the nuts into a medium-mesh sieve set over a container to catch the cooking oil.) Let them cool completely. (Fried nuts can be stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator or freezer for up to 3 months.) One hour before serving, remove the cake from the refrigerator, invert it onto a serving plate, and release it from the pan. Sprinkle the powdered sugar on top: Hold a fine-mesh sieve over the cake, pour the powdered sugar into it, and gently tap the rim to release the sugar. Garnish with the nuts, and serve in wedges.\n",

      "\n",
      "Start by heating an oven to 340F/170C. Place the marshmallows and butter into a pan and turn on the heat. Melt while stirring with a spatula to keep it from scorching. The marshmallows will gradually melt. It is OK once there are no lumps. Remove from heat. Add the finely grated coconut and almonds while it is still hot, and mix everything together until well-combined. On a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, wet your finger tips, pinch to about 2-3 cm in diameter, and lay on the sheet. Press down slight with your fingers to flatten out a little. It'll spread out while baking, so make sure to give plenty of spaces in between! You should spread it out even more than shown in the photo for Step 5. Bake in an oven at 170C for about 10-15 minutes. Tip: Make sure to keep an eye on them so they don't burn. They are done once they have turned golden brown and have flattened out. They are soft right after baking, but will harden immediately. If you let them sit for a bit, then you will have cookies that have become crispy and crunchy and are light in your mouth! I thought about forming the cookies into a curve like tuiles, but they are really soft and it's difficult to bend them unless you work fast. I gave up halfway through. It's flavored with caramel just like florentine, and crunchy and light in your mouth . The coconut and almond are fragrant and really delicious! Another photo of the cookies.\n",

Place a cheesecloth into a colander, and pour the milk mixture through it. Reserve some of the liquid for later. Let the milk mixture sit in the colander for a couple of hours, or until it stops dripping. After the curds are strained and settled, transfer them to a food processor. Process until smooth. It should be able to form a ball if it is the right consistency. If it is too dry, add a little of the reserved liquid and process again. The consistency should be like a firm ricotta cheese. Turn the cheese out onto a clean surface, and knead until smooth. Form into a ball, and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate until needed. To cook the paneer, heat the oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Cut the paneer into bite size pieces. Fry for about 1 minute, or until a very pale golden brown.

Remove onion and mushrooms from pan and set aside. Put ground turkey into the same pan, breaking apart the chunks into \"ground meat\" consistency. Cook, stirring frequently, until little or no pink shows. Return onion and mushrooms to pan, and add dried spices, cook on low heat, stirring often, until all the meat is done and the mushrooms and onions have released all their liquid and are beginning to caramelize. Adjust seasoning, if needed, and add water if the mixture is sticking to the pan too much. Continue cooking until the meat and vegetable mixture is no longer \"wet. \". Using the spatula, loosen any stuck-on bits on the bottom of the pan, and add the sour cream, mixing well. Serve immediately over zucchini ribbons, spaghetti squash, or your choice of starch. On the MediFast plan, this meal would serve two. On a regular plan, it would serve 3-4.\n",

Very lightly butter two 9-inch tart pans. (If you can see butter youve used too much.) Roll out dough and line tart pans. Using a fork, pierce rows of holes in the bottom, about an inch apart. This will allow steam to escape and aid in even baking. Refrigerate uncovered for several hours or preferably overnight.

Generously flour the work surface and with with a heavy-duty rolling pin roll each portion of the dough as thin as possible into an 8\" to 9\" round. These breads are meant to be roughly shaped. Thinness is more important than the shape. The dough should be thin enough to see your hand through it. Place several rounds of dough on an ungreased baking sheet and place in the oven or place on a baking stone with a baker's peel. Bake until the top of the bread is firm and lightly browned, about 3 to 4 minutes. Baking time will vary and will also depend on the number of breads placed in the oven. With tongs or your fingers, turn the bread over and bake until the other side is slighly browned, 3 to 4 minutes more.

      "Bread Mix---------. Mix well in a large tub or bowl. If you like herbs in your bread, add 2 T sweet basil, or a mix of Italian herbs. Mix well with a wire whisk. Then put in plastic containers to store. To Bake----------------. Mix and blend well. No need to knead, just mix well, until the dough is smooth, makes a firm ball, and is not sticky. If sticky, add some more flour until it's firm. Put it in the refrigerator and let it sit for a day. If you don't have a day, let it rise for a couple of hours, punching it down when it doubles. This will develop a much better flavor and crust. If your in a hurry the dough can go into the oven as soon as you roll it out, and let it rise for 15 minutes. This is a very forgiving recipe so don't worry. Now when your ready to bake, separate the dough into 3 pieces. With a little flour scattered on your counter, roll each piece of dough out into a circle about 1/2 inch thick. Set on greased baking sheets. Then let the dough proof or raise for 15 minutes. Then put your fingers into the dough, making some impressions, brush with melted butter or olive oil, and then very lightly with Italian sauce. Get creative with your toppings if you want. Parmesan, and fresh rosemary are great. Bake at 375 for 15 to 20 minutes until nicely browned and crusty. The bottom should be brown as well. Brush again with melted butter or olive oil. Now when the bread has cooled, wrap in plastic wrap completely, and freeze.\n",

Smooth out any wrinkles that form on the sheet pan, grease with the vegetable oil and set aside. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, combine the sugar and water and bring to a boil, without stirring. Add the corn syrup and continue to boil the sugar, brushing down the sides of the saucepan with a brush that's been dipped in water to force down into the pan any crystallized sugar that forms on the walls of the pan. When the sugar reaches 250 degrees F, gradually add the butter, but do not stir. Continue to cook the sugar until it starts to turn a light caramel color. Remove from the heat and add the salt and baking soda, stirring to distribute. Pour the sugar over the silpat and cover evenly, making a thin sheet over the silpat. While the sugar is still warm, sprinkle the pine nuts and pumpkin seeds over the candy. Allow to cool completely before breaking and serving.\n",

      "For the pre-ferment:. Stir together the flours, salt, and yeast in a large bowl or the bowl of an electric stand mixer. Add 3/4 cup water, stirring until everything comes together and makes a coarse ball (you can mix it with the paddle attachment -- I think it is easier to do it by hand). Adjust the flour or water as needed; the dough shouldn't be too sticky or stiff. Flour your work surface and transfer the dough. Knead for 4-6 minutes (or mix with the dough hook for 4 minutes), or until the dough is soft and pliable, \"tacky but not sticky. \". Transfer the dough to a lightly-oiled bowl and roll it around to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and ferment at room temperature for one hour, or until it swells to 1 1/2 times its original size. Remove the dough from the bowl, knead lightly to degas, and return it to the bowl, covered with plastic wrap. Refrigerate for up to three days or freeze in an air-tight plastic bag for up to three months. Bread:. Remove the pre-ferment from the icebox and cut into 10 small pieces (I use kitchen shears). Let it sit an hour, covered with plastic wrap, to take off the chill. Stir together the bread flour, semolina flour, salt and yeast in a large bowl or bowl of an electric stand mixer. Add the pre-ferment pieces, oil, honey, and 1 1/4 cups water. Stir until the dough forms a ball, or use the paddle attachment at low speed. Add water in dribbles as necessary to achieve a soft and pliable dough. Lightly flour your work surface and knead your dough (or use a dough hook at low speed), adding flour as needed to achieve a soft but not sticky dough, for about 10 minutes. Form the dough into a ball, lightly oil a large bowl, and roll the dough around in the bowl to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. At this point I refrigerate the dough overnight. Mr. Reinhart, instead, ferments the dough at room temperature for 2 hours or until it doubles, divides the dough gently in three pieces, shapes the dough (see below), taking care not to degas it too much, places the dough on a baking pan (or pans) lined with parchment, sprinkles with sesame seeds (see below), covers with plastic wrap, and refrigerates overnight. As explained in the preamble, in my hands the dough over-rose in the refrigerator, lost its shape, and wouldn't rise in the oven. And thus I divide, shape and bake the loaves the next day as explained below. It gives me more control of the proofing process. The next morning take the dough from the refrigerator (it will have grown) and divide it gently into 3 pieces. Gently shape as you wish, taking care to degas as little as possible. To achieve the S shape shown in the photograph, extend each dough piece to about 24 inches. Working from each end simultaneously, coil the dough (in opposite directions) towards the center. Place the shaped doughs on parchment-lined pans, mist with water, sprinkle with sesame seeds if desired, mist with vegetable oil spray, and cover with plastic wrap. Proof the dough for an hour or two; it is ready for the oven when it stays dimpled when poked. The loaves should be about twice as large as when first shaped, but DON'T let them over-rise. Preheat the oven to 500F (my oven is too rickety to get that hot; I have to use the convection option). Uncover the doughs and place in the oven; Pour 1 cup of water in the steam pan. Mr. Reinhart also sprays the oven walls with water three times at 30 second intervals, and then reduces the heat to 450F. Bake for about 15 minutes and then rotate the pans 180 degrees. Gently separate the loaves if they are touching. Continue baking for 10-15 minutes to achieve a rich golden brown. The internal temperature of the bread should be about 200-205F. Transfer the loaves to a cooling rack and cool for at least 45 minutes. To freeze, when cooled, wrap each loaf in a freezer bag and close with a wire twist.\n",

      "First peel the peaches. Cut an X at the bottom then lower them into a pot of boiling water for about 20 seconds. Using a slotted spoon, transfer them to a collander and shock them with cold water. Let them cool and the skin will peel right off. Cut the peaches in half, remove the pits and cut them into chunks. Cook them with the water in a medium, nonreactive saucepan over medium heat, covered, stirring once or twice, until soft and cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, stir in the sugar and then cool to room temperature. Remove about 1/4 of the peaches and cut them into slightly smaller chunks and reserve. Puree the rest of the peaches and their liquid in a blender or food processor with the sour cream, heavy cream, vanilla and lemon juice until almost smooth. Add the reserved peaches back in and chill the mixture thoroughly, preferably overnight, in the refrigerator. Freeze in your ice cream maker according to directions. An hour or so before churning the ice cream, make the raspberry swirl by mashing the raspberries together with the sugar and vodka with a fork until they're juice but with nice-sized chunks of raspberry remaining. Chill until ready to use. When you remove the peach ice cream from the ice cream machine, layer it in a container with spoonfuls of the chilled raspberry-swirl mixture. Freeze until ready to serve. It will get really hard after about 3 hours, so you may want to let it warm up a little for ease of scooping. Garnish with fresh raspberries.\n",

Leave the crackers on the pan and bake on the middle rack of the oven for 25 minutes or until the edges just start to darken. Remove from the oven, set the sheet pan with the crackers on a cooling rack and allow to cool completely. Once completely cool, break into individual crackers and store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks.\n",

If using a mixing bowl, add the oil and cut in with a fork until the mixture is crumbly. In a stand mixer, mix at medium speed; in a food processor, pulse until crumbly. Add the water, and mix with your hands (or at medium speed in a mixer or food processor) until you can gather the dough into a ball. Lightly dust your work surface, and roll out the dough, or roll out between pieces of parchment, plastic or wax paper. Cut into desired shapes -- squares, diamonds or cookie-cutter shapes -- and place on the baking sheet, close together but not touching. Bake 15 to 20 minutes until lightly browned, switching the sheet trays halfway through from front to back and top to middle. Remove from the heat, and allow to cool on racks.\n",

Place peach slices on top of blueberries. If they are frozen make sure they are also thawed and drained of excess water. Drizzle 1/4 cup apple juice over fruit. Remove pits from dates and place in the bowl of a food processor along with oats, almonds and cinnamon. After running for a minute and dates are blended with oats and almonds, add apple juice, and mix well. Place mixture evenly over peaches and blueberries, and bake uncovered for about 45 minutes. Serve warm or cool. Healthy Cooking Tips:. Make sure the topping is well ground, and mixed while still ending with a coarse texture. It will have a tendency to be in clumps after processing it. When you place it over the fruit mixture crumple it with your hands into an even layer. Otherwise it will be in big clumps and will not look or taste as good.\n",

Sprinkle the filling onto this part of the dough. Cover it with the other part of the dough. Roll up from the short side to form a spiral. The plastic wrap will be of help. For Jumbo spirals roll up from the long side (a little bit tricky). Cover in plastic wrap and put into the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Meanwhile preheat oven (390F/200C). Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Take spiral out of the fridge and cut with a long knife into 1/4 - 1/2 inch thick slices. Before each cutting put knife into very hot water. Place spirals on baking paper with the aid of a cake shovel. Bake for 15-20 minutes until slightly to light golden brown. Take tray out of the oven and let cool spirals on tray for 5 minutes. Using a cake shovel remove spirals from tray and let cool completely. NOTE: the roll up and forming of the spiral as well as the cutting into slices can sometimes be a little bit tricky, be patient.

Stir lightly, and let stand in a warm place until mixture develops a creamy foam, about 7 minutes. (If mixture doesn't foam, discard and start over with new yeast.) Sift flour and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the middle, and add yeast mixture and oil and stir to incorporate the flour until dough holds together and just come away from side of bowl. Add a little more water if needed. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead. Lightly flour your hands if necessary. Knead (by using the heels of your hands and your body weight to push away from you, pull it back and fold in the sides of the dough towards the center. Turn the dough right angle every few kneads) until dough is smooth, soft, and elastic, about 10 minutes. Form into a ball. Lightly oil a large bowl, put the dough into the bowl and turn the dough so that all sides are coated. Cover the bowl tightly with a plastic wrap/damp tea cloth and let dough rise in a warm (75-80A degrees F), draft-free place until doubled in bulk, 1-3 hours. The dough is ready when it does not spring back when poked with a finger. Part 2: Finishing the dough - Using the dough Uncover the dough, punch it down and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Flatten it and make a well in the center. Sprinkle baking powder in the well, gather up the sides and fold to the center to incorporate the baking powder. Knead lightly for a few minutes till it becomes a ball again. Divide the dough into two cylinders about 1 inch thick. Cut each into 10. Make 20 1-inch ball portions. Cover dough with a damp tea cloth as you work. Proceed with dumpling recipes\n",

      "Stir the vinegar into the cream to acidify it, then refrigerate it to keep it cold. Place the butter in the freezer, for at least 30 minutes, to harden. Whisk the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Place a cheese grater in or over the bowl of dry ingredients. Remove the butter from the freezer, unwrap it, and grate it through the large holes into the dry ingredients, tossing the butter threads in the flour mixture as you grate to distribute them. (An alternative method is to place the butter on a cutting board, and dust it and the work surface with flour. Cut the butter into 1/4-inch slices. Dust the slices with flour, stack a few of them up, and cut them into 1/4-inch strips, then rotate the stack a quarter turn and cut the strips into 1/4-inch cubes. Its okay if the butter is smaller, such as pea-size. Toss the floured butter bits into the dry ingredients and continue cutting all of the butter in the same manner and adding it to the flour mixture. You can see why I like the grater method better.) Use your fingertips to separate and distribute the butter pieces evenly, breaking up any clumps but not working the butter so much that it disappears or melts into the flour. Add the cream mixture and stir with a large spoon until all of the flour is hydrated and the dough forms a coarse ball. Add a tiny bit more cream if necessary to bring the dough together. Transfer the dough to a generously floured work surface, then dust the top of the dough with flour. Working with floured hands, use your palms to press the dough into a rectangle or square about 3/4 inch thick. Use a metal pastry scraper to lift the dough and dust more flour underneath. Dust the top of the dough with flour as well, then roll it out into a rectangle or square about 1/2 inch thick. Then, using the pastry scraper to help lift the dough, fold it over on itself in three sections as if folding a letter. Rotate the dough 90 degrees, then once again lift the dough and dust more flour underneath. Dust the top with flour as well, then once again roll it out into a square or rectangle about 1/2 inch thick and fold into thirds. Give the dough another quarter turn and repeat this procedure again. Then, repeat one final time (four roll-outs in all). After the fourth folding, dust under and on top of the dough one final time, then roll the dough out to just under 1/2 inch thick, in either a rectangle (for triangle- or diamond-shaped biscuits) or an oval (for round biscuits). Use just enough flour to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface. Cut the biscuits with a floured metal pastry scraper or pizza cutter, or with a floured biscuit cutter for rounds; a 2-inch biscuit cutter will yield 20 to 24 small biscuits. Transfer the biscuits to an ungreased sheet pan (lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat if you like), placing them about 1/2 inch apart. Let the cut biscuits rest for 15 to 30 minutes before baking to relax the gluten; this will create a more even rise (even better, if you have room, place the pan of biscuits in the refrigerator to chill). If youd like to bake the biscuits later, see the sidebar for make-ahead options. About 20 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 500F (260C). Transfer the biscuits to the oven and lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C), or 425F (218C) for a convection oven. Bake for 8 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for another 6 to 10 minutes, until both the tops and the bottoms of the biscuits are a rich golden brown; the baking time will be shorter in a convection oven. The biscuits should rise about 1 1/2 times in height. Place the pan on a wire rack, leaving the biscuits to cool on the hot pan for at least 3 minutes before serving. The biscuits will stay warm for about 20 minutes. These biscuits are perfect without the addition of other ingredients, but it can be fun to enhance them with sweet or savory flavors. Here are four variations. Feel free to create your own versions, using these as examples. To make cheese biscuits, grate 8 ounces (227 g) of Cheddar or any medium-soft cheese you like, such as Gruyere, Gouda, or Provolone. This will yield about 2 cups of cheese. Each time you fold the dough, sprinkle one-fourth of the cheese over the surface before folding it. This may look like a lot of cheese, but it will melt and almost disappear into the biscuits when you bake them. To make savory biscuits, layer caramelized onions into the biscuits when you fold them. Youll need to cook the onions well in advance, because its important that they be cool when you layer them; otherwise, theyll cause the butter in the dough to melt, which will damage the texture of the baked biscuit. To make the onions, slice 2 large white or yellow onions into thin strips. Saute them over medium heat in 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) of vegetable oil until very soft and translucent. Add 2 tablespoons (1 oz / 28.5 g) of sugar and, optionally, 1 tablespoon (0.5 oz / 14 g) of balsamic vinegar, and continue cooking and stirring until the pan juices thicken into a honeylike syrup and the onions have the consistency of marmalade. This will take 15 to 20 minutes altogether. To make other savory variations, read on. Seasoned biscuits make a nice accompaniment to eggs, especially if made with fresh herbs. You can use any combination of fresh basil, parsley, dill, chervil, cilantro, or whatever herbs you like. Use about 3/4 cup of fresh herbs, either minced or cut into thin strips. Be careful when using strong herbs or spices, such as rosemary, oregano, sage, anise, fennel, cumin, chili powder, and the like, as they can easily overpower the biscuits. Use these stronger seasonings in moderation and in combination with milder herbs like parsley. Ground pepper is always an option; just 1/4 teaspoon will provide a surprisingly strong kick. Dried herbs will also work, but dont use more than 1/4 cup; and again, use primarily mild herbs like parsley, chervil, and basil. To make sweet variations, keep in mind that there is very little difference between a biscuit and a scone, so consider sweet biscuits to be flaky, tender scones and try adding dried fruits such as currants, raisins, cranberries, cherries, pineapple, apricots, or blueberries, as well as candied ginger (in moderation). Cut larger dried fruit into small bits. Add 1 cup (6 oz) of dried fruit (or more, if you like) in any combination, when you add the cream. Just dont use fresh fruit or berries, as they would make the biscuits soggy and destroy the flakiness. The single most important technique is to use very cold butter and liquid. Some biscuit makers go so far as to chill the flour, but this isnt necessary if the butter and cream are cold. Using cold ingredients ensures that the butter stays in bits and pieces, which shortens the gluten strands (thus the term shortening, used to describe all solid fats, including butter and margarine). Using bits of cold butter creates weak points in the dough that flake off when you take a bite. Work quickly to keep the dough cold, but dont overwork the dough. Gluten is what makes dough tough, and the more you mix the dough, the more organized the gluten strands become. As a general rule of thumb, mix only as long as needed to get the job done. As every great biscuit maker will attest, its all in the touch. The folding technique described in the recipe is similar to the lamination method known as blitz. It creates many thin layers of dough and fat, causing the biscuits to puff up and open like an accordion, creating maximum flakiness. The oven must be hot in order to trap the butter inside the biscuit and increase the puffing quality. In a cooler oven, below 450F (232C), some of the butter might run out onto the pan, so preheat the oven to 500F (260C), then lower the heat to 450F (232C) as soon as you put the biscuits in to bake. (If you preheat the oven to 450F (232C), it will drop to below 400F (204C) when you open the door.) Chilling the biscuits before baking them not only relaxes the gluten, it also minimizes the amount of butter that may run out of the biscuits as they bake. The best way to make biscuits is to bake them 15 to 30 minutes after the dough is cut, placed on the pan, and briefly chilled. However, when this isnt always practical, its better to bake the biscuits when you plan to eat them rather than bake them in advance and try to warm them up later. So here are three make-ahead options: Freeze: Cut and pan the biscuits but dont bake them. Instead, completely wrap the pan (under and around the pan) in plastic wrap or use a food-grade plastic bag. If you wrap it well, you can freeze the pan of unbaked biscuits for up to 1 month. Remove the pan from the freezer at least 3 hours before you plan to bake the biscuits so they can thaw. Dont bake them while theyre still frozen or they wont rise or bake evenly. If freezer space is an issue, you can also wrap individual biscuits in plastic wrap, stack them up, and freeze them. Refrigerate: Wrap the pan or individual biscuits as described above, but instead of freezing, refrigerate them. This is especially practical if you plan to bake the biscuits within 3 days. For even baking, remove the biscuits from the refrigerator about 30 minutes before baking to remove some of the chill. Parbake: Bake the biscuits as described in the recipe, but only until slightly golden on the tops and bottoms4 to 5 minutes less than the full baking time. Remove the pan from the oven and cool the biscuits thoroughly before wrapping them individually or wrapping the entire pan and freezing. When you want to finish baking them, preheat the oven to 450F (232C) and place the frozen biscuits on an ungreased baking sheet. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until the tops and bottoms of the biscuits are golden brown. Cool for 5 minutes before serving; this allows the heat to reach the center, warming but not drying out the biscuit.\n",

You may want to break up the granola with a spatula about half way through. Remember as it cools, it will harden and become more crunchy. This is DELICIOUS with some homemade almond milk!\n",

      "Preheat oven to 350F. In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugar. Mix in flour, baking powder and salt at a low speed, followed by the vanilla and milk, adding in the milk as needed to make the dough come together without being sticky (its possible you might not need to add milk at all). The dough should come together into a soft, not-too-sticky ball. Add in a bit of extra flour if your dough is very sticky. Roll the dough (working in two or three batches) out between pieces of wax paper to about 1/4-inch thickness (or slightly less) and use a 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter to make rounds. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet and use a knife, or the end of a wide straw, to cut a smaller center hole. Repeat with remaining dough. Alternatively, use scant tablespoons of dough and press into an even layer in a mini donut pan to form the rounds. Bake cookies for 10-12 minutes, until bottoms are lightly browned and cookies are set. If using a mini donut pan, bake for only about 10 minutes, until edges are light gold. Cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Take oven temperature down to 300. Spread coconut evenly on a parchment-lined baking sheet (preferably one with sides) and toast 20 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes, until coconut is golden. Cool on baking sheet, stirring occasionally. Set aside. Unwrap the caramels and place in a large microwave-safe bowl with milk and salt. Cook on high for 3-4 minutes, stopping to stir a few times to help the caramel melt. When smooth, fold in toasted coconut with a spatula. Using the spatula or a small offset spatula, spread topping on cooled cookies, using about 2-3 tsp per cookie. Reheat caramel for a few seconds in the microwave if it gets too firm to work with. While topping sets up, melt chocolate in a small bowl. Heat on high in the microwave in 45 second intervals, stirring thoroughly to prevent scorching. Dip the base of each cookie into the chocolate and place on a clean piece of parchment paper. Transfer all remaining chocolate (or melt a bit of additional chocolate, if necessary) into a piping bag or a ziplock bag with the corner snipped off and drizzle finished cookies with chocolate. Let chocolate set completely before storing in an airtight container.\n",

      "Makes about 12 ounces. A 12 ounce Ball canning jar is ideal for storage, but this will be refrigerated anyway so you can use whatever you have. But if you have a canning jar, make sure the jar, lid and ring are clean. 1. Put the frozen pineapple, apple, lemon juice, vanilla extract, cardamom and water into a medium sized saucepan. With the lid on, bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat. Cook the mixture, stirring every couple of minutes with a wooden spoon (remember that pineapple is acidic so a metal spoon might alter this mixtures flavor), until the fruit is completely softened. This will take about 30 minutes. If you are making this with fresh pineapple, your cooking time will vary so keep an eye on it! I happened to have a bag of frozen pineapple from Trader Joes, so thats what I used. 2. Once mixture is cooked and soft, carefully add it into a food processor or blender and puree until its completely smooth. 3. Pour the puree back into into the pan and add the brown sugar and vanilla bean sugar. Of course, plain granulated sugar will work, should you not have vanilla bean sugarbut I might up your extract to 1 1/2 teaspoons if you do this. Cook over low heat, uncovered, and stir until the sugar dissolves. 4. Bring the mixture back to a gentle simmer and cook 8-10 minutes while stirring occasionally. You are looking for a nice and thick texture with no water left in the pan. Keep an eye on this process. It can easily burn from all the sugars. 5. Once mixture is thickened and water has evaporated, remove from the heat and carefully pour into your cleaned and dried glass jar with a tight fitting lid. A Ball canning jar is perfect. Fasten lid and allow to sit at room temperature or until you hear the pop! from the lid. This means the jar is sealed. This should take about 30-40 minutes on your counter. Will store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Enjoy at home or add a crafty label and give as a gift!\n",

Using a pastry blender, cut in cold butter until mixture is crumbly. Add buttermilk and water and stir with a form until completely combined and sticky dough forms. Chop half of the dried cranberries into small pieces and leave the remaining whole. Add cranberries and orange peel to dough and fold gently. On a lightly floured surface, form dough into a ball. With lightly floured hands, pat the dough into a 10-12 inch diameter circle. Score the circle into 8 wedges. Place each wedge onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 18-20 minutes until lightly browned. Immediately, gently brush melted butter on tops of scones. Serve warm with jam and/or Devonshire cream.\n",

      "1. Put cream in a large bowl and let it sit at room temperature for an hour. 2. Using a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the cream until it separates. You will first reach soft peaks, then stiff peaks, then a sort of chunky texture. Finally, your cream will separate into a white liquid (buttermilk) and yellow curds (butter). 3. Drain the butter using a sieve set over a small bowl. Reserve the buttermilk for drinking or recipes. 4. Put the butter into a bowl and add some cold water (about 1/4 of a cup). Work the butter and water together with a rubber spatula to separate out as much of the buttermilk as possible. The water will get cloudy. Drain the water and continue to add, work, and drain water until it runs clear. 5. If you want salted butter, add the salt and work in with the rubber spatula. Taste and add more if desired. 5a. (optional) Add some finely chopped parsley and basil to make herb butter or mix in some honey and cinnamon to make sweet butter to spread on muffins or toast. 6. Store in an airtight container in the fridge. For step-by-step photos and descriptions, see the related blog post link.\n",

Add the flours to the yeast mixture. Add agave, oil, cocoa powder, rest of the water and knead 6-8 minutes in stand mixer or 8-10 minutes by hand. I used 1 Tablespoon cocoa. Use 1 more for a darker bread. If the dough is sticky, then add a little bread flour until the the dough is soft and almost not sticky. Place dough in well greased container. Cover with towel and let sit for 1 1/2 hours or until doubled. Punch dough down, use a tablespoon or so bread flour to help handle the dough and knead for a few seconds. Pull a bit on all sides and tuck under to get a taut top. Place the tucked side down on parchment lined or well greased bread pan. Or flatten the dough and roll like a jelly roll. Place with seam side down in the bread pan. Spray water liberally on top, then sprinkle some flour or oats on top. Or spray oil. Cover with towel and let rise for 40 minutes or until doubled. Bake at 365 degrees F for 35-40 minutes, or until a tap on the top sounds hollow. Cool completely before slicing. To make buns, divide dough into 6 or so equal size pieces. Roll into balls or shape by pulling on all sides and place on parchment lined sheet. Spray liberally with water. Sprinkle liberally with sesame seeds or other seeds of choice. Cover with a towel and let rise for 30 minutes. Bake in preheated 365 degrees F for 25-30 minutes until the tops are golden brown and sound hollow on a tap. Note: To get nice slices, cool the bread in the refrigerator for at least an hour before slicing. Also if possible use an electric knife. Variations:. Add a teaspoon of caraway seeds. Add 1-2 Tablespoons non dairy yogurt. Replace 1/2 cup water with 1/2 cup almond milk(half the amount of liquid).\n",

Using low speed, slowly add water mixture to flour mixture. Mix on medium speed until there are no lumps, about 2-3 minutes. With your mixer on low speed, add wheat flour and oatmeal half a cup at a time. Then add remaining bread flour half a cup at a time until dough clears the side of the bowl. Dough will be sticky. Turn onto a floured surface and knead until dough is smooth (apx 5 minutes) adding the raisins as you go along. Add more flour 1 tablespoon at a time as necessary. Turn into oiled bowl and flip dough so that top of dough is oiled. Cover and let rise until double, approximately 60-90 minutes. Using lightly oiled hands, turn out dough and shape into 2 small round loaves and place on greased baking sheet OR 1 large loaf and place in 9x5 bread ban, cover and let rise 60-90 minutes. If you like a softer crust, brush tops of loaves with oil. Preheat oven to 375 degrees and bake for 40-45 minutes. Check bread after 30 minutes and cover with foil if its getting too dark on top. If making two smaller loaves, they may be done sooner. Remove bread from pans and cool completely on a wire rack.\n",

      "In a small bowl, combine the yeast, 1/2 cup of the warm water, and the honey. Let stand until slightly frothy, about 5 minutes. Add the oil and mix. In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the yeast mixture into it, mixing it into the flour with a wooden spoon. Add the remaining 2 cups warm water, 1/2 cup at a time. Shape the dough into a sticky ball and knead on a clean, well-floured work surface until very smooth and elastic, a good 10 minutes (add more flour as needed, a little at a time, if your dough is too sticky to knead). Place the dough in a greased glass or plastic bowl and cover with a towel. Let rest in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours to rise and double in size. Knead the dough on a floured surface for another 10 minutes (again, adding flour as needed) and roll it into a tube about 1 foot long and about 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter. Using a sharp knife, mark 16 equal lines on the roll of dough, then break the dough into 16 pieces of equal size and roll each into a ball. On the same floured surface, roll out each ball with a rolling pin or tall glass until the dough is 1/4 inch thick and 6 inches in diameter, resembling a small pizza. Place each rolled-out piece of dough on a floured piece of foil cut to the same size as a baking sheet, 4 to 5 at a time, until all 16 have been made. Cover the flattened dough pieces with a kitchen towel and let them rise in a warm spot for another 2 hours. (At this point, preheat the oven to 550F for 2 hours. It is important to get the oven temperature as high as possible so that each pita bakes quickly and forms a pocket.) Carefully lift up one sheet of foil with the risen dough pieces and place on a baking sheet. Bake on the middle rack in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes. Do not open the oven more than a crack until you see the bread puff up. Take the sheet out and remove the baked pita breads, placing them in a basket and covering them with a clean cloth to keep warm. Discard the used foil and transfer another sheet of unbaked pieces to the baking sheet. Continue to bake in this manner, one sheet at a time, until all the pitas are baked. Serve immediately alongside any maazeh salad or spread or as a sandwich with ijeh in its pocket. These really dont stay soft and fresh past a day, but if you have a lot left over, store them in a zipper-lock plastic bag for up to 2 days on the counter or 1 week in the freezer, toasting them in the oven when needed.\n",

I usually roll it out till it's 5-8 mm thick. you'll want to handle your dough gently from now as it is rising. smooth on a thin layer of margarine, sprinkle brown sugar and cinnamon in even layers on top.

In a large mixing bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda, nutmeg and salt. Create a well in the center of the flour to pour the wet ingredients into. Mix the soymilk mixture with a fork to dissolve the cornstarch and pour into the flour mixture. Add the oil, sugar and vanilla, and mix well. Fill the liners with batter 3/4 full. Place a heaping spoonful of jam into the center of each cupcake, being careful not to overfill. The jam will sink into the cupcake during baking so don't worry about pressing it down. Bake cupcakes for 21 to 23 minutes. Don't do a toothpick test, but tops should be firm. Cool completely on a wire rack, and then set uncovered overnight in a cool and dry place. This will make the tops slightly crispy, like a donut crust. Using a sifter, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve.\n",

When the water comes to a boil, turn the heat down to low and steam for 10 to 12 minutes. Done. Be careful not to let the condensation fall on the bread when you remove the lid off. This is a cocoa version. I added 1-2 tablespoon of cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon sugar and a little vegetable oil (optional) to the basic batter, and steamed the same way. The bread looks like this when it's cut open. So fluffy and light! Add 1 tablespoon condensed milk and 1 tablespoon skim milk powder, and use 160 ml of water instead of milk. The cocoa version above is topped with chocolate chips, and made in mini muffin cups. Chocolate and cocoa do go well together. We've really been in to raisin steamed bread recently in our family. Just mix some raisins into the basic batter. This time the raisins sunk to the bottom. When I divided the dough into 7, water often got into the cups while cooking, so I tried making 8 instead and this worked a lot better. So I recommend making 8 at a time.\n",

Taste, add sugar as necessary, and blend again. (Don't add too much sugar - the leather will become sweeter as it cooks anyway! ). Pour the mixture onto the plastic-covered tray and use a spatula to spread evening over the tray to 1/8-1/4 inch thickness. Preheat oven to 150 degrees (you may have to crack the oven door to keep the temperature that low). Place tray in oven and leave for 6-8 hours. Invert the fruit leather onto another baking sheet covered in plastic or silicon baking pad, and oil, and remove the first lining. Place in the oven for another 6-8 hours. If it becomes too brittle at any point, simply brush on water with a pastry brush to rehydrate it. Cool the sheet tray and cut the fruit leather into desired sizes.

      "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

In 3 increments, add the flour mixture to the creamed butter, mixing between each addition and scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary. Add the milk and vanilla extract, blending until combined and the dough begins to come together in large pieces. Use your hands to divide the dough in half and makes disc like shapes with each one. Wrap them each in plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour. Once the dough has chilled, roll each disk out onto a lightly floured surface until it is about 1/8 inch thick. Cut out as many cookies as possible with a donut shaped cookie cutter. Place the cut out cookies on a Silpat or parchment paper lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough. Bake the cookies for about 10-12 minutes, rotating the baking sheet halfway through, until the cookies are a pale golden brown. Immediately transfer to a wire rack and cool completely. Spread coconut flakes on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake the coconut for about 10 minutes in a 350F oven until toasted, stirring frequently to ensure even browning and so that it does not burn. Remove from oven and set it aside. Melt the caramels, milk, and salt on low on the stove. Cook, stirring until the caramels are fully melted. Remove from heat and combine 3/4 of the caramel mixture with the toasted caramel in a large bowl. Carefully spread the remaining 1/4 cup of caramel atop the cooled cookies then press on a portion of the coconut/caramel mixture. Repeat for each cookie. If the coconut/caramel mixture becomes too hard to manage, reheat mixture on very low heat until spreadable again. Melt the dark chocolate in microwave on on stove on low. Once fully melted, dip the bottoms of the cookies in the chocolate and place them on wax paper. Drizzle some chocolate over the tops of the cookies as well. Let the cookies sit until chocolate fully hardens. Helpful tips! *No donut shaped cookie cutter? Use a regular cookie cutter and a small dry spice lid for the smaller hole. *If dough is too firm after being in the fridge, let it rest at room temp for 10 min. *The shortbread should be very pale in color. When in doubt, underbake it! *Coconut burns very quickly so keep an eye on it and stir often! *Spreading the cookies with the reserved 1/4 cup of caramel gives the coconut mixture a sticky base to adhere to.\n",

Makes sufficient dough for four 10-inch thin-crust pizzas. Dough balls can be tightly wrapped in plastic and refrigerated one week, or possibly frzn up to 1 month. On a lightly floured surface (preferably a chilled baking sheet or possibly tray) using a floured rolling pin, roll out 1 ball of dough 1/8 inch thick (about 10 inches in diameter). Using a pastry brush, lightly brush upper crust with oil. If it's a very warm day, the dough may get too soft to transfer easily to grill, if so, pop the tray into the freezer till hard, about 15 min. Prepare grill and preheat to medium. Trying not to stretch the dough, carefully transfer it, oiled side down, to rack of grill. Grill crust, covered, till undersides are golden, about 3 min. (If one side of grill is hotter than the other, rotate the pizzas partway through cooking.) Brush upper crust with oil and flip crusts over with 2 metal spatulas. Top each crust with desired toppings. Grill, covered, about 5 min more, or possibly till undersides are golden, cheese is melted and toppings are heated through. Makes four 10-inch pizza crusts.\n",

      "Combine all crust ingredients in a mixer and knead for 10 minutes. Place in a large bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and allow to ferment as long as possible (12 to 24 hours). Punch down dough now and then when you get a chance. Preheat oven to 550 degrees F. Roll the dough as thin as desired. Roll, flour, flip and repeat until you end up with a shape equal to 90% the size of your pan, as it will stretch when you transfer the dough. Place dough on pizza stone or in pan. Brush with vegetable oil and prick with fork. Pre-bake for 3 minutes. Remove from the oven and spread with cherry, blueberry or apple pie filling. If you want whole pieces of fruit with a thick topping, you will need 1 whole large can, otherwise you will need to puree half the filling if you want a thinner topping. After you have spread on the filling, you put on the crumb topping. Mix well with a fork or pastry blender. Spoon over pie filling. Use as much as you want of the topping. Put the rest in a zip-type bag in the refrigerator to save. Return pizza to the oven and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes or until crust is light golden brown. Remove and drizzle with Vanilla Glaze. Yields one 16-inch dessert pizza.\n",

On a lightly floured board, use a rolling pin to turn each circle into a nice flat tortilla. Add a bit of oil to the pan if needed (I dont use oil on my nonstick pan), and then cook each tortilla one by one about 30 seconds on each side (it will puff up).

      "Line a 9-by-9-inch baking pan with plastic wrap, overlapping as needed to completely cover the bottom and sides and leaving at least a 5-inch overhang. (If possible, use a pan that does not have sloping sides.) Place the ice cream in a large bowl and add the nuts and marshmallows. Working quickly, fold the nuts and marshmallows into the ice cream with a rubber spatula until evenly combined. Drop the ice cream in large dollops into the prepared pan and spread to the edges with a rubber spatula. Cover with the overhanging plastic wrap and press on the surface of the ice cream with the bottom of a measuring cup until its packed into a smooth, even layer. Freeze until solid, at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Tape each corner of the paper down and place the baking sheets in the freezer. When the ice cream is solid, remove the pan and 1 baking sheet from the freezer. Grasping the plastic wrap, pull the ice cream slab out of the pan and place it on a cutting board. Remove and discard the plastic wrap. Slice the slab into 9 even squares. Using a flat spatula, transfer and evenly space the squares on the baking sheet. Freeze until solid, at least 2 hours. Fill a large bowl with 2 inches of cold water, add 3 to 4 ice cubes, and set aside. Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, reduce the heat to low and maintain a bare simmer. Place 24 ounces of the chocolate in a large, dry, heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan and stir with a rubber spatula until the chocolate is completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F. If either happens, start over, as the chocolate is no longer usable.) Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the remaining 8 ounces of chocolate and stir constantly, scraping against the bottom of the bowl, until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. To speed the cooling process, after all of the chocolate has melted you can place the bowl over the reserved cold-water bath. Return the bowl to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat. Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range or it will not set up properly.) Keep the saucepan over low heat and use it to reheat the chocolate as necessary. To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on parchment or waxed paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set. If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered. (If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.) Have a fork and flat spatula ready. Remove the empty baking sheet and the baking sheet with the ice cream squares from the freezer. Working quickly, use the flat spatula to drop 1 ice cream square into the chocolate. Using the fork, flip the square, making sure the edges are covered in chocolate. Lift the square out of the chocolate with the fork and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl to even out the coating. Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate. Place the coated square on the empty baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining squares and chocolate, tilting the bowl as needed to pool the chocolate in one area, and spacing the squares as close together as possible on the baking sheet without touching. (If the ice cream squares start to melt, return them to the freezer until firm before continuing.) Freeze the dipped ice cream bars until the chocolate coating has hardened and the ice cream is solid, at least 2 hours. Wrap them individually in plastic wrap, then foil, and store in the freezer for up to 2 weeks.\n",

      "Make the starter. Combine yeast and water in a medium size mixing bowl. Stir until the yeast is fully dissolved. Add flour and stir until thoroughly mixed. Cover with a cloth and let stand for exactly 30 minutes. Make the dough. Combine water, honey, and yeast in the bowl of a heavy duty stand mixer. Stir until the yeast is fully dissolved. Add shortening, flour, salt and the starter. Mix on low speed until the dough is fully developed. To determine whether it is fully developed, start testing after the dough comes together and leaves the sides of the bowl. To test, stop the mixer, and take a small piece of dough and stretch it slowly with the thumb and fingers of each hand. If the dough tears easily, mix it for a few more minutes, and test again. It's fully developed when the dough forms a translucent \"window\" when stretched. Divide the dough into 2 pieces. Roll each into a smooth ball. Place on a pastry mat or on waxed paper (or in a proofing basket) and cover with a warm, damp cloth. Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes exactly. Preheat oven to 400F now (so it will be thoroughly hot when time to bake). Form the dough into loaves, place into loaf pans, if using them. Cover with a warm, damp cloth, and let rise for 30 minutes at room temperature (or in a slightly warmer spot, like the top of the oven). Make three 1/2\" scores on the top of each loaf with a sharp knife. Spray with water, and bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the crusts are deep golden brown and a thermometer inserted into the center registers 190-200F If not using loaf pans, you can place the loaf directly on a hot baking stone. Remove the bread from the oven and remove from the loaf pans (if using). Cool 30 minutes before slicing. Store in a paper bag or in a bread box. You can freeze one baked loaf, allow to thaw for a few hours, and reheat in the oven.\n",

      "In a small bowl, whisk water and salt together until salt dissolves. Transfer salt water and potatoes to the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal blade and process until coarsely ground, 10 to 12 pulses, stirring occasionally. Drain potato mixture in fine-mesh strainer, pressing potatoes with a spoon until dry (liquid should measure about 1 1/2 cups); discard liquid. Transfer potatoes to a microwave safe bowl and microwave, uncovered, until dry and sticky, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking. Stir flour, black pepper and cayenne pepper(optional) into potatoes. Spread potato mixture into thin layer over large sheet of aluminum foil and let cool for 10 minutes. Push potatoes to center of foil and place foil and potatoes in 8-inch square baking pan. Push foil into corners and up sides of pan, smoothing it flush to pan. Press potato mixture tightly and evenly into pan. Freeze, uncovered, until firm, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 200 degrees F. Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet; set aside. Heat oil in a saucepan over high heat until 375 degrees. Using foil overhang, lift potatoes from pan and cut into 1 1/4 by 1-inch pieces (6 cuts in 1 direction and 8 in other). Fry half of potato tots, until golden brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes, stirring occasionally once they begin to brown. Drain prepared baking sheet, season to taste and place in oven. Bring oil back to 375 degrees and repeat with remaining potato tots. Serve warm. Recipe Notes:. If your food processor has a capacity of less than 11 cups, youll need to process the potatoes in two batches. If any large pieces of potato remain after processing, chop them coarsely by hand.

With folded sides facing down, fit foil securely into bottom and up sides of 8-inch-square baking pan, allowing excess to overhang pan sides. Spray foil with nonstick cooking spray. Toss chocolates, baking soda, and salt in medium heatproof bowl until baking soda is evenly distributed. Stir in sweetened condensed milk and vanilla. Set bowl over 4-quart saucepan containing 2 cups simmering water. Stir with rubber spatula until chocolate is almost fully melted and few small pieces remain, 2 to 4 minutes. Do not melt the chocolate completely or the fudge may become greasy. Remove bowl from heat and continue to stir until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth, about 2 minutes. Stir in marshmallows, peanuts, and chocolate chips. Transfer fudge to prepared pan and spread in even layer with spatula. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Remove fudge from pan using foil and cut into squares. Let come to room temperature for a few minutes before serving. Walnut: Stir in 1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts instead of peanuts and marshmallows in step 3. Peanut Butter: Substitute 18 ounces peanut butter chips for chocolates in step 2 and omit walnuts. Can add 1 cup chopped salted toasted peanuts for crunch. The fudge is best to be eaten within a few days, because it will dry out as it sits. It can be stored tightly wrapped in the freezer, however, for up to three months. TO MAKE DOUBLE BATCH:. Line 13 by 9-inch pan with two sheets of foil placed perpendicular to each other and double amounts of all ingredients. In step 2, use large heatproof bowl and Dutch oven containing 4 cups simmering water.\n",

      "Leave it up to the bread maker up to the first rising. Will you just barely be able to get it to gather up? Please adjust the amount of water so that it does just that. Rising complete. Let's do the finger check without leaving that up to the bread maker. If the hole closes back up after sticking in your finger, then keep an eye on it for a bit longer. This is a sticky dough, so sprinkle with lots of flour, and roll it up after separating it. Cover with a wet cloth, and let rest for 25 minutes. Mold into your desired shapes, spray with lots of mist to keep it from drying out, and let rise for the second time at 35C for 40 minutes. Bake at 180C for about 13 minutes. If you want to keep it white, then sprinkle the surface with bread flour and bake at 150C for 11 minutes. This is the ultimate secret technique! After it has cooled a bit after baking, place it into a plastic bag, let sit until it completely cools, and completely close in the moisture. I made tuna corn cheese bread with this dough.\n",

      "Mix rub ingredients and set aside. With a good sharp fillet knife debone the pork shoulder. Coat all sides with the rub. Replace the bone and tie roast with butchers string (100% cotton). Coat all of the outside with BBQ rub. Wrap the roast with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. Set up your grill for Indirect Heat with a drip pan in the middle. First layout unlit charcoal. Then add hot charcoal to the top. Add water to the drip pan. Placed roast on center of grill over the drip pan and add a few handfuls of wet hickory wood chips. Close the lid and smoke @ 275F to 300F until you have an internal temperature of 195F or higher. This should take 4 to 5 hours, or maybe longer. When done remove from the grill cover with aluminum foil and rest for 20 minutes. When cool shred the pork and serve on toasted buns with your favorite BBQ sauce. Serving suggestion: in some areas of the United States it is traditional to put coleslaw on a pulled pork sandwich.\n",

Once fork-tender, drain and set aside and allow to cool to the point that they can be handled for cutting. While potatoes are cooking, wash sweet frying peppers and cut them into 1/2-inch thick rings. To remove the seeds, place them under running water and press the seeds out with a finger or a thumb. Over medium-low heat, add olive oil to a large frying pan and cook the onions and peppers until they begin to soften, about 10 minutes. While peppers and onions are softening, slice yellow potatoes about 1/8-inch thick. Once the peppers have softened, add granulated garlic, paprika, cayenne and salt to the pan. Stir to combine and cook for 1 minute. Turn heat up to medium-high and add remaining olive oil to the pan. Once hot, fold in potatoes. Saute until the potatoes are heated through and browning a little. Serve immediately. Note: Use less or more cayenne to taste. 1/8 teaspoon creates a medium heat.\n",

      "Combine the water and yeast in a large mixing bowl and let stand until the yeast is dissolved. Add the mashed sweet potatoes,milk, melted butter, brown sugar, and salt. Stir until all ingredients are evenly combined. Add the flour, stirring until a shaggy dough is formed and no more dry flour is visible. This dough will be very sticky. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel and let stand until doubled in bulk, at least 2 hours or as long as 5 hours. Refrigerate from 2-24 hours. When ready to shape the rolls, sprinkle your work surface with a little flour and turn the dough out on top. Sprinkle a little more flour on top and press the dough into a thick disk. Use a bench scraper or knife to divide the dough into 24 pieces. Shape into balls and place about 5 inches apart on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover and allow to rise until the rolls are roughly doubled in size, about 45 minutes in a warm kitchen. About 20 minutes before the rolls are finished rising, preheat the oven to 400 Fahrenheit. Remove the cover and bake the rolls for 20-25 minutes, until they are puffed and toasted brown. Serve warm or room temperature. Rolls are best the first day, but will stay fresh for several days after if stored in an airtight container. Notes:. To make the mashed sweet potatoes, roast a medium-sized (roughly 9 ounce) sweet potato in a 400 oven until completely soft. Strip off the skin and mash. For extra richness, brush the tops with melted butter or egg yolk before baking. So good! These rolls can also be frozen if you're making them ahead of time. Allow the baked rolls to cool completely, wrap them in aluminum foil, and freeze them. To re-heat, let them thaw on the counter and then warm them in a 300 oven for 15 minutes. Preparation time includes rising and refrigeration time.\n",

Slide a dull knife along the edges. Cool for 5 minutes. Carefully turn the slab of shortbread out onto a clean surface. With a knife, trim 1 inch from one of the long sides.

Since these are Vegan, you and your kids can eat as much dough as you want while you are making them and dont have to worry about getting sick. They are soooo tasty and hearty, and very good for you. Its a great way to disguise health food and get your family to try it! I like these as a quick grab and go snack, or for breakfast.

      "Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and water in a mixing bowl. If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute. If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute, until well blended. The dough should be coarse and wet. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour. Drizzle the olive oil over the dough, then resume mixing on medium-low speed using the paddle attachment, or by hand using a large wet spoon or wet hands, for 1 minute. The dough should become smoother but will still be very soft, sticky, and wet. Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface. With wet or oiled hands, reach under the front end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough. Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball. The dough should be significantly firmer, though still very soft and fragile. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Repeat this entire process three more times, completing all repetitions within 30 to 40 minutes. (You can also do the stretch and folds in the bowl, as shown on page 17.) After the final stretch and fold, return the dough to the oiled bowl and immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days, or pan it immediately (as described below). To make 1 large focaccia, line a 12 by 16-inch sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat. Oil it generously, including the sides, with about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, then transfer the dough to the pan. Drizzle another tablespoon of oil over the top of the dough, then use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it to cover about half of the pan. Make sure the top of the dough is coated with oil, then cover the pan (not the dough) tightly with plastic wrap and immediately place the pan in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 4 days. For round focaccia, cut out a piece of parchment paper to fit inside an 8- or 9-inch round pan. Oil both the parchment and the sides of the pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, then transfer the dough to the pan. For an 8-inch pan, use 8 ounces (227 g) of dough; for a 9-inch pan, use 12 ounces (340 g) of dough. Drizzle 1 teaspoon of olive oil over the top of the dough, then use your fingertips to dimple the dough and spread it as far as it will allow. Dont force the dough when it starts to spring back. Cover the pan (not the dough) tightly with plastic wrap and immediately place the pan in the refrigerator overnight or for up to 4 days. Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 2 1/2 hours before you plan to bake, and if you havent already panned it, follow the instructions above to do so, spreading it to cover a portion of the pan. Warm the oven for just a few minutes, then turn it off; or, if you have a gas oven with a pilot light, its warm enough without any heating. Drizzle a small amount of olive oil on the surface of the dough and, beginning in the center and working toward the sides, dimple the dough with your fingertips to spread it over more of the pan. The dough will start resisting and sliding back toward the center after a minute of this; stop dimpling at that point. It should now be covering 70 to 80 percent of the pan. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and put it in the warm oven (with the heat off!). For a gas oven with a pilot light, leave the focaccia in for just 5 minutes. Otherwise, leave it in for about 8 minutes. (If you have plenty of time, you can simply let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes between dimplings, which will require a total of about 4 hours prior to baking.) After the focaccia has been out of the oven for 10 minutes, remove the plastic wrap, drizzle another small amount of olive oil over the dough, and dimple it again. This time it should cover about 90 percent of the pan. Cover it again and return it to the warm oven for 5 minutes in a gas oven with a pilot light or 10 to 20 minutes for any other type of oven. On the third dimpling (if not the second), the dough should evenly fill the entire pan. If it creeps in from the corners because of the oil, dont worry; it will fill the corners as it rises. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and proof the dough in the slightly warm oven as before, removing it after 5 to 10 minutes and completing the rise at room temperature. It should be about 1 inch high in 1 to 1 1/2 hours (longer if not using the oven). Preheat the oven to 500F (260C). (You dont need a baking stone, but if youd like to use one, allow 45 minutes for it to preheat.) Top the focaccia with your choice of toppings (see page 70 for topping ideas), but wait until the end of the baking time to add any cheese. Place the pan in the oven. For large focaccia, lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C) and bake for 12 minutes. Rotate the pan and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, until the top of the dough is golden brown. For round focaccia, keep the oven temperature at 500F (260C) and bake for 10 to 12 minutes. If you use moist toppings, such as fresh tomatoes or sauce, the focaccia will take longer to bake. To test for doneness, use a metal spatula to lift the edge of the focaccia so you can see the underside; it should be a mottled golden brown in spots, not white all over. If youre topping the focaccia with cheese, add it when the focaccia appears to be done, then bake for another 2 to 4 minutes to melt the cheese. When you remove the focaccia from the oven, run a pastry blade or metal spatula along the sides of the pan to loosen the focaccia, then carefully slide the focaccia, parchment and all, onto a wire rack. If any olive oil remains in the pan, pour it over the top of the focaccia. Cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.\n",

      "1. Pick clean and wash the beans. Put them in a bowl and add water to cover by at least 2 inches, and let them soak for 8 hours. Drain and rinse the beans. 2. Add the beans and 1 1/3 cups water to the container of a food processor or blender and puree them. The puree should be extremely smooth, light, and fluffy. Transfer to a large bowl. 3. Line a sieve with a double layer of cheesecloth and put the cream of rice cereal in it. Hold the sieve under cold running water right in the kitchen sink. Rinse the cereal until no clinging starch is remaining and the water begins to run clear through the cheesecloth. Squeeze the rice cereal thoroughly of all moisture and add it to the bean paste. Beat the bean and rice mixture thoroughly. Add salt if desired. Cover the bowl with a kitchen towel or plastic wrap and place it in a warm place for 8 to 12 hours to ferment the batter. 4. When you are ready to make the dumplings, stir the baking soda gently into the batter, using a rubber spatula. (Do not overblend as the batter must remain foamy and airy for the dumplings to come out light.) Let the batter rest for 4 to 5 minutes. 5. While the batter is resting, cut pieces of cheesecloth into neat rounds or squares to fit the depressions of the idlee dumpling racks. Each piece of cheesecloth lining can be used twice. Therefore you will need half as many pieces for lining as the number of dumplings. The cheesecloth pieces should be slightly larger than the depressions so that they overhang by about 1/3 inch. 6. Line the dumpling racks with the pieces of cheesecloth. Brush them lightly with oil. Bring water to a boil in the idlee steamer, a pressure cooker, or a 6- to 8-quart sauce pot in which the idlee racks fit. 7. Spoon about 1/4 to 1/3 cup batter into each lined depression of the rack. Attach the racks and place in the steamer. 8. Steam the dumplings for 12 to 15 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into them comes out clean. Remove the racks from the steamer apparatus and separate the dumpling racks. Pick up each dumpling with the cloth and gently peel away the cheesecloth. Place the steamed dumplings in another steamer or a covered dish to keep them warm. 9. Turn the cheesecloth pieces over and line the racks with the smooth reverse side up. Brush lightly with oil. Proceed with the remaining batter the same way. To serve, place the dumplings (2 per person) in a rimmed soup plate or a shallow bowl about 5 inches in diameter. Make an indentation in the center of the dumpling with your index finger or with the back of a wooden spoon. Pour about 1 to 1 1/2 teaspoons sesame oil in the depression and over the dumplings.\n",

Beat coconut sugar, vanilla and apple cider vinegar into almond butter mixture until well combined.

Make sure you scrape all the flour off the sides of the bowl into the mixture. Pour batter into the prepared pan and smooth out evenly. Sprinkle with the chopped nuts.

Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean and the edges are crisp, about 5055 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting into bars and devouring (see note). Notes: 1. Gluten free baking can be tricky, so I highly recommend measuring your flour to make sure you get perfect results. 2.

If you want them to be super easy, you can leave an overhang of parchment paper, so you can lift them out of the pan to cut once they are cooled. 3. Dont like microwaves? You can melt them together on the stove too! 4. Since these brownies and dense, you need to cook them low and slow. Resist the urge to check them before the time is up, or they will deflate. Also, make sure they are completely cooled before cutting. If you want them to be a little firmer, then let them completely cool in the refrigerator. 5. Store blondies in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\n",

      "Notes: To glace citrus peel, you should use 3/4 pound of peel and halve the remaining ingredients. Recipe may be doubled or tripled but should not be done in any larger batches than that - fruit can become too 'cooked'. Don't double or triple recipe for pears; they become too mushy. Yield is approximate and depends on fruit used. First Day: Prepare fruit (see below). Combine all ingredients except fruit in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil. Add prepared fruit. Heat syrup-fruit mixture to 180 F. on a candy thermometer. Remove from heat. Cool. Cover and let stand at room temperature 18 to 24 hours. Second Day: Drain syrup from fruit. Add second quantity of sugar to syrup and bring to a boil. Remove from heat. With a large metal spoon, skim any foam from the surface of the fruit and discard. Put fruit back in syrup and heat to 180 F. again. Remove from heat, cover and let stand at room temperature for 18 to 24 hours. Third Day: Repeat same process as second day, but add the third quantity of sugar. Fourth Day: Repeat same process, using fourth quantity of sugar. After final standing time, remove fruit from syrup. Place in a colander and rinse in cold water. Dry on drying trays at 120 to 140 F. until fruit is leathery and has no pockets of moisture. Drying time for glace' fruit will be one-fourth of the drying time for resh fruit because so much moisture has been replaced by FRUIT-FLAVORED PANCAKE SYRUP: Bring syrup to a boil, skim the foam, and pour into hot sterilized canning jars, filling them to 1/2 inch from the top. Seal with two part lids and process 5 minutes in boiling water bath. PREPARING FRUIT: Apples: Washi, peel, core and slice 1/4 inch thick. Apricots: Wash and cut in half; remove pits. Cherries: Wash and remove stems and pits. Citrus Peel. Use only the colored part of the peel. Cover with water and boil 15 minutes. Drain before adding to syrup. Peaches: Wash and scald, slip skins off, pit and cut into 1/2 inch slices. Pears: Wash, peel thinly and core. Cut lengthwise in 1/2 inch slices. Do not prepare large quantities at a time as the soft texture will begin to deteriorate. Pineapple: Wash and peel. Remove thorny eyes. Cut lenthwise and remove the core. Cut crosswise in 1/2 inch slices. Prune Plums: Wash, cut in half and remove stones. Flatten by pushing in the cupped side with your thumbs.\n",

Cover and cook over high heat until it comes to a very rapid boil. Remove the cover and continue to cook at medium-high heat until the sugar takes on a golden brown caramel color. Remove from the heat, stand back, and slowly add the cream. The mixture will bubble and steam furiously. When the bubbling has subsided, return to the heat. Whisk the caramel and then let the mixture come to a rolling boil. Immediately remove from the heat and add the rum. Serving Suggestions: This sauce should always be served warm. To reheat this sauce after it has been refrigerated, either heat the sauce directly over the stove, stirring with a rubber spatula, or place the container of sauce in a bowl of hot water. It goes well with any chocolate dessert, and with the Maple Walnut Souffle, Pumpkin Souffle, and Roasted Apple Beignets.\n",

Meanwhile preheat the oven to 450 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment. Place the flour in a large, wide bowl and sift in the baking soda and salt. Mix in with your hands or with a wide spatula. Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the buttermilk. Add the bulgur to the well, then mix in the flour from the sides of the bowl to the center using a wide rubber spatula, a wide wooden spoon or your hands, turning the bowl and sweeping the flour from the sides into the buttermilk. Mix until the bulgur and buttermilk have been incorporated into the flour, then scrape out onto a lightly floured work surface. The dough should be soft and a bit sticky. Flour your hands so it wont stick to them. Gently knead the dough, only enough to shape it into a ball, then with floured hands gently pat it down to a 2-inch high round, about 9 inches in diameter. Place it on the parchment-lined baking sheet and cut a 1/2-inch deep cross across the top. Place in the oven and bake 20 minutes at 450 degrees. Turn down the heat to 375 degrees and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes, until the loaf responds with a hollow sound when tapped on the bottom.

In a medium pot (2 quart) combine brown sugar, maple syrup, and butter. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently. Sugar mixture should be boiling and will start to thicken when it is ready after about 6-9 minutes. Turn off the heat, and quickly stir in the vanilla and baking soda; the mixture will turn lighter in color and will become foamy. Evenly pour the sugar mixture over the popcorn. Sprinkle with the bacon bits. Place the pan into the oven and cook for 30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes. Let the popcorn cool and harden, break into pieces and store in an airtight container.\n",

Then pour into a jug, stir in the sugar and dried yeast and leave it in a warm place for 10-15 minutes till there is a good frothy head on it. Meanwhile, sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl and make a well in the centre. When the yeast mixture is frothy, pour it all into the mixing bowl. Slowly work the flour into the liquid with a wooden spoon. Beat well at the end to make a perfectly smooth batter. Cover the mixing bowl with a tea-towel and leave to stand in a warm place for about 45 minutes - by which time, the batter will have become light and frothy. When you're ready to cook, grease the insides of the cooking rings very well and add a little oil to your frying pan before placing it over a medium heat. When the pan is hot, arrange the rings in the frying pan and spoon 1 tablespoon of the batter into each ring. Let them cook for 4 or 5 minutes: first tiny bubbles will appear on the surface and then, suddenly, they will burst, leaving the traditional holes. Now take a large spoon and fork, lift off the rings and turn the crumpets over. Cook on the second side for about 1 minute only. Re-grease and reheat the rings and pan before cooking the next batch. Serve the crumpets while still warm, generously buttered and topped with anything that takes your fancy. Strawberry jam or lemon curd are particularly good. If you are making your teatime treat in advance, then reheat them by toasting lightly on both sides before serving. (Bought crumpets need toasting on the highest setting of your toaster to give you a similar result).\n",

      "- Have the cocoa, peanut butter, and oats pre-measured out before start and laid aside as they will be needed quickly. - Also lay about 2 feet of tin foil out on the counter in advance (ungreased). - Begin by putting white sugar, milk, and butter/margarine in cooking pot on the stove. - Turn fire on medium-low and stir continuously. - Wait for things to heat up and you want to adjust the fire to keep it at the perfect level, which is tiny, tiny bubbles slowly coming up almost like its on the verge of beginning to boil. (If there are bubbles everywhere and things are starting rumble, its too high). Note: Very important to NOT overcook as sugar burns easily and tastes awful. - Once its at the perfect level, stir constantly for about 2 minutes than turn fire off but keep pot in place. - Drop in cocoa and quickly stir until all chunks are out. - Drop in peanut butter and stir until completely melted and stirred inches. - Drop in oats and stir in completely. - Quickly remove and using spoon, begin scooping up/dropping globs onto foil depending on size desired (I prefer a little over a tablespoon). - Let sit uncovered for 20 minutes, allowing them to harden up. - Once hardened, wash hands and scoop a little bit of creamy peanut butter onto tip of pointer finger. - Lightly and gently dab the top of a cookie with the tip of your finger and lift up, leaving a tiny Hershey-kiss shaped pile. Do this 8-10 times all over the top of each cookie (scooping up more onto finger as needed). Note: The amount done depends on taste; it just adds a hint of salty peanut butter taste on the top. You can easily break a test cookie in thirds to test 3 different amounts to find desired taste. - Once done, leave uncovered for a few hours before wrapping up. This allows peanut butter to dry-out and harden on top. - Eat and enjoy! ~TRY THESE TASTY, FUN IDEAS!~. ~ Make a batch but with every cookie unique, adding special things on top before hardening such as caramel candies, mini-marshmallows, raisins, white chocolate kisses, coconut, cashews, peanuts, pecans, walnuts, dark chocolate M&Ms, candy corn, frosting.etc! ~ Divide everything all the ingredients by 3 to make 3 different pots then take each pot and use a different filler; batch #1 using oats, batch #2 using rice crispies, cereal, and batch #3 using frosted corn flakes! ~ Use bigger globs and after putting each one down, push a small Reese peanut butter cup in the middle instead of dabbing peanut butter on after done! ~ Use 1/2 cup extra oats and 3 1/2 inch globs and after putting each one down, push in 3 robin egg candies to make robins nests! ~ To holiday-ify, get small candy-coated Hershey kisses, pick out holidays colors (ex: red, green, & white for christmas) and right after putting each glob down, push a few onto the top of each cookie! ~ Instead of using globs, flatten with a spoon into 1/4 inch thick 3in square or circle and later use in place of chocolate bar when making yummy s'mores! NOTE: You'll see I used specific brand names for 2 things. The peanut butter because after using a few brands, me and others agreed that this one definitely tasted the best for the cookies. The oats because other brands such as Quaker were MUCH different textured and were hard and completely ruined the taste or texture of the entire experience. So following these aren't required but very recommended.\n",

      "DAY ONE:. Sterilize all equipment, if necessary. I do not have to in my kitchen because I get a bubbly starter by Day 4. The first step, whether or not you sterilize, is to scrub all pieces of equipment with hot water and dishwashing liquid, and dry with paper towels. Then to sterilize, place the equipment in a large pot of boiling water for 5 minutes. Lift it out of the pan with tongs and allow to dry on paper towels. To begin starter, start early in the day. Measure 1/2 cup distilled water into a sterilized bowl using a sterilized measuring cup. Add 1 cup of organic flour, and stir with a sterilized spoon. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 12 hours. After 12 hours, add in 1/2 cup distilled water and 1 cup organic flour, and leave again at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 12 hours. DAY TWO:. Wash and sterilize dry measuring cups and spoon again. Add 1/2 cup distilled water and 1 cup of the organic flour to the starter and leave again at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) for 24 hours. DAY THREE:. Repeat step 4. If the starter has not begun to bubble, wait one more day before discarding it. DAY FOUR:. If the starter is bubbling, repeat step four again, and transfer it to a larger sterilized bowl, before adding in flour and water. If the starter has not begun to bubble by Day 4, discard and start over again. DAY FIVE:. Discard half of the starter and add 1 cup distilled water and 2 cups organic flour. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and leave at room temperature (60 to 80 degrees F) until bubbly. Refrigerate starter after it begins to bubble. Maintenance:. Feed the starter by removing it from the refrigerator, discarding half of it, and repeating step 6, once a week. If any water separates out of the starter in between feedings, stir the water back inches After the starter is several weeks old, remove 1 cup and try feeding it with 1/2 cup ordinary tap water and 1 cup unbleached all purpose flour. If it begins to bubble easily, continue to use tap water and unbleached all purpose flour on a weekly basis.\n",

Turn the lefse as you roll it and keep it well coated with flour to prevent sticking. The dough is soft, but try to use as little flour as possible. Preheat an electric griddle or frying pan to 375 degrees, or use a griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Lightly grease with oil. Shake excess flour off each circle of lefse and place it in the pan. It will start to bubble; cook until the bubbles are lightly browned, about 1 1/2 minutes. With a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Stack the lefse on a wire rack as they are cooked, or wrap them in foil and keep warm in a 200 degree oven.

      "Add yeast to warm water, stir well and leave to rest for about 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, add about half of the flour. Make a well in the centre and pour in the yeast mixture. Start bringing the flour into the centre with a fork and stir until you have a batter-like consistency. Cover and let rest for about 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, add oil, honey and salt and stir to combine. Add remaining flour and work it in with a wooden spoon until you have a dough-like consistency. Turn dough out on a floured surface. At the moment, the dough will be quick sticky. You will have to use a little extra flour for your work surface and for kneading. Start kneading dough, turning and kneading as you go. Add little bits of flour every time you notice it is sticking to the work surface. Continue this process until dough is quite elastic and bounces back when touched. This will take up to 10 minutes. Once it has reached this consistency, form it into a ball and place it into a large bowl. Cover with a damp tea towel and put it in a warm place to rise. Leave the dough until it has about doubled in size. This will take anywhere between 3060 minutes. It will depend on how warm your space is. While dough is rising, get two bread loaf pans ready. Grease bread pans and line with parchment paper. Grease parchment paper as well. Set aside. When dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out into two equal parts. I like to then divide each piece into 3 small little oval loaves and put 3 in a pan. You can just as easily keep each one in one large loaf. Cover and put them back in a warm place to rise. Again, you are looking for them to double in size. Remember that the size you see when it has finished rising will be the the actual size of your loaf when it has finished baking. The second rise will probably be 3040 minutes. Bake bread in preheated 350 degrees F oven for about 3035 minutes. It should be golden in colour and quite a tough crust to touch. Turn bread out on a baking rack and remove parchment paper. You can cut into this bread straight away. Delicious! Note: You will need a little extra flour for kneading your dough.\n",

(can do by hand with spoon if you don't have a mixer). Add the oil, the yeast mixture, and the remaining 3/4 C water, mix on low speed until dough comes cleanly away from the sides of the bowl and clusters around the dough hook, about 5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, then simply add a bit more flour until it pulls cleanly away from the hook. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead by hand 2 or 3 minutes. The dough should be smooth and firm. Place in lightly oiled bowl an cover with plastic wrap. Let sit for about 30-45 minutes. (When ready, the dough will stretch as it is lightly pulled). Take dough out of bowl and divide into either 2 or 4 balls, depending on whether you want 2 large pizzas or 4 small. Work each ball by pulling down the sides and tucking under the bottom of the ball. Repeat 4 or 5 times. Cover the dough with a damp towel (I just use plastic wrap, loosely fitted) and let rest 15 to 20 minutes. At this point, the balls can be used or wrapped in plastic and refrigerated for up to 2 days. To make pizzas, I stretch out onto greased pizza pan, top with sauce and toppings, and bake at 450 degrees for 12-16 minutes, until done. (smaller pizzas will take less time, so keep watching it) I usually slide the pizza off the pan for the remaining 2 minutes to crisp it up a bit.\n",

Pour pan of warm milk into a one quart jar, then add yogurt mixture. Partially fill a 1 gallon drink cooler with 110 degree water (I use one with the spout in the lid, but any small cooler will work). Place jar in cooler and make sure the water comes up to just below the lid. Cover cooler and place in a warm, sunny spot in your yard for 6-8 hours!

Take the pot of rice off the heat and put aside to cool (rice should resemble a \"soggy mess\"). Lightly coat a shallow tray or cookie sheet with oil, add some of the cooked rice and spread into a thin layer. You may need several trays, depending on their size. Put the tray(s) out to dry in the sun (or into a warm oven). When the rice starts to dry (but not yet fully dry), use a knife to cut the sheet of rice into 2 to 3 inch squares. Turn the pieces over and continue to dry thoroughly. The squares of crusty rice can now be either deep fried until lightly browned, or toasted. If fried, drain well. They can be stored for several days in airtight jar. Place the coconut milk into a sauce pan and add the crushed cilantro roots/stems, chopped garlic, ground (chopped) raw shrimp meat. Stir well and put on medium heat. Stir until the coconut milk starts to boil, and continue to cook until the shrimp meat is cooked. Add tomato paste and chopped shallot (onion). Continue cooking for a few more minutes until the shallot is cooked. Add fish sauce, sugar, and crushed peanuts. Bring to a second boil and take off the heat. Serve warm in a bowl, with either toasted or fried crusty rice squares. Garnished the dip with chopped cilantro leaves and slices of medium hot red chili peppers.\n",

Flour your hands and form the mass of dough into a ball without kneading. Gingerly lay the dough on a lightly floured tea towel, then fold ends of the towel on top of the dough. Let the bread rise again until doubles in size, which can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours. About 30 minutes before second rise is over, preheat oven to 400. Put a 4 12 or 5 1/2 quart cast iron casserole (about 10\" in diameter) with its cover in oven to preheat along with the oven itself. For the next step: Make sure you have heavy oven mitts (it'll be tohot for a towel and proceed with care). Take casserole out of oven using oven mitt and lay on a heat resistant surface. Remove cover and lay aside. Take the towel with dough and quickly flip dough into casserole (it will go in \"upside down\" which is fine). Shake casserole, if need be to center dough and then quick re-cover it. Put casserole back in oven and bake for 30 minutes. Take out of oven and remove cover (the bread will be ever so slightly browned). Put casserole back in oven, uncovered and bake for another 15-20 minutes, until bread has developed a beautiful golden brown crust. Turn bread out onto a cooling rack and leave until it has completely cooled. When coolded completely, after about 45 minutes to an hour, it is ready to enjoy.\n",

      "Line an 8-inch-square baking pan with aluminum foil that extends over the sides. With a paper towel, coat the bottom and sides of the foil with 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Set aside. In a 4-quart heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream to a boil. Add the sugar, corn syrup, and honey and stir constantly with a wooden spoon or heatproof spatula until the mixture comes to a boil (about 5 minutes). Wash down the sides of the pan two times with a pastry brush dipped in warm water to prevent the sugar from crystallizing. Place a candy thermometer in the pan, increase the heat to medium-high, and cook the mixture, stirring occasionally, until it registers 257F on the thermometer (about 15 minutes). Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, vanilla paste, and 2 teaspoons of the sea salt. Pour the caramel into the prepared pan and let it sit at room temperature until cool and set (about 1 hour). With the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil, coat a cutting board and the blade of a large chefs knife. Remove the candy from the pan by by lifting out the foil; invert the caramel onto the cutting board and peel the foil off of the caramel. Cut the caramel into eight 1-inch-wide strips, then cut each strip into four pieces. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Melt and temper the chocolate (see pages 2530). Place a caramel into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or fork remove the caramel from the chocolate, carefully shake off the excess chocolate, and slide the caramel off the dipper onto the paper. After dipping 4 caramels, sprinkle the center of the top of each with a pinch of sea salt. Let the caramels set up at room temperature, or chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. In a tightly covered container between layers of waxed paper, the caramels will keep for 1 month at room temperature.\n",

Bring the mixture back to a boil and continue to cook for 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and cool. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and place on a lightly floured surface. Roll out each dough into a circle about 12 inches in diameter and 1/8-inch thick. Fold one of the dough into fourths and carefully remove the dough from the surface. Unfold the dough into a 9-inch by 2-inch deep dish pie pan. Pour the berry filling into the pastry shell. Place the remaining circle of dough over the filling. Lightly press the pastry into the berry mixture. Using a small knife trim off any excess and crimp the edges. Place on a parchment lined baking sheet. Place in the oven and bake for about 45 minutes or until the crust is golden. Remove and cool for 20 minutes before slicing. Serve each slice with a scoop of ice cream.\n",

While it is still hot, cover with a large bowl to retain heat until it cools to room temperature. Once completely cooled, remove from mold and wrap carefully to prevent it from drying. Store in the refrigerator overnight, then it's ready to decorate. Bake two of these sponge cakes to make a layered birthday cake. Spread maple syrup on top of the bottom layer, then whipped cream and strawberries. Next, place the top layer of sponge cake on top and coat with whipped cream, decorated with sliced strawberries and cut kiwi fruit. Please feel free to decorate as you like. You may use any kind of vinegar, such as grain vinegar or rice vinegar, but based on my experience, apple cider vinegar came out tasting the best. At first, when you add the vinegar, the smell is strong enough to make you wonder if it's really okay, but once it is baked, the smell disappears, so don't worry. Here it is as a Christmas cake decorated together in 2006. And again as a birthday cake in 2007. The sweetness is milder than regular sponge cakes, and was a hit.\n",

Use your hands to bring it together in the bowl. Add additional yogurt one teaspoon at a time if its too dry. You want a stiff, slightly tacky ball. Turn dough onto a lightly floured board and shape it into a round loaf. (Dont over-knead the dough. Too much kneading will produce a tough bread). Transfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make deep slashes across the top of the loaf, 4-6 cuts about half way through. Brush the top of the loaf with milk. Sprinkle with seeds or oats if using.

Mix with a rubber spatula or whisk until smooth. Pour the batter into a cake pan greased with oil. In winter, let rise for 30 minutes; in the summer, 20 minutes. The times are guidelines. The picture shows it after it has risen. (see Step 15 and 16) Once the rising has finished, cover the pound cake pan with kitchen parchment paper, then top that with aluminum foil. Preheat the oven to 200C and bake for 30 minutes. To prevent the cake from drying out, bake it along with a heatproof dish filled with hot water. For the bread pictured in the top photo, I removed the paper and foil in the last 5 minutes of baking to brown on top. After baking, immediately remove from the pan. Let cool on a rack. Once cooled, wrap with plastic wrap. Let it cool completely before slicing or it will not slice cleanly. Wrap individual slices in plastic wrap and store in the freezer. If you toast it, the outside will be crunchy and the inside will be soft. I tried making it into a sandwich. Don't use fillings with a lot of moisture. This recipe is steamed in the microwave rather than the oven.. For the rising, you can use the rising setting on your oven. To prevent it from drying out, bake with 2 trays of hot water. After pouring the batter into the pan, be sure to tap it against a counter or work surface to release the air bubbles. If there are air bubbles, the cake will end up with big wholes and lack smoothness.\n",

Lightly flour a 2- to 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter and cut the biscuits, leaving as little space between each cut as possible and pressing down just once for each biscuit; do not twist the cutter. If the dough begins to stick to the cutter, dip the cutter in a little flour. Gather the excess biscuit dough, reroll once, and cut as many biscuits from it as possible. Arrange the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with cream, sprinkle with sugar, and bake until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. While the biscuits are baking, combine the strawberries and remaining 1/4 cup of the sugar in a bowl and mash lightly with a fork or your hand to release some of the juices. Remove the biscuits from the oven, split in half, and place a pat of butter in the middle, allowing the butter to melt. Spoon the strawberries over and serve warm.

Place in a greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place until the dough is doubled. Turn out of bowl onto floured surface. Deflate the dough by kneading gently and let rest 15 minutes. Divide dough into six pieces and shape each piece into a rope. Braid three pieces into a loaf; repeat with remaining pieces. Place each braid into a greased loaf pan, cover and let rise until nearly doubled. Preheat oven to 400 deg F (200 deg C) Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes.

You want a mild flavor, not too salty but enough to taste it. Add the Harina P.A.N little by little as you mix with your hands. Stop adding the corn meal just before the mix becomes solid. It should be the consistency of a thick pancake batter at this stage. Continue to stir vigorously with your hands until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and forms a very soft ball. Sprinkle additional corn meal into the mix if the dough doesn't firm up at all. Pick up the dough and slap it down back into the bowl a few times to speed up the process. Note: the dough should never become as firm as a ball of bread dough or pizza dough. There is no real kneading involved. When the dough forms a nice, moist ball, break off a small piece and work it in your hands rolling it into a small ball (about 1-2 inches) and then gently flattening it so it is about 3 inches across and 1/2inch tall. Note: if the dough cracks on the edges when you flatten it, it is too dry. Wet your hands and try again. Place the arepa on the preheated griddle and continue forming the rest in the same manner. Flip the arepas just before they are about to burn, when the bottom is golden brown. Allow them to brown on the other side. At this point the arepas are done, but for an added touch of authenticity, place the arepas into the preheated over directly onto the racks and allow them to bake for 10-15 minutes or until they puff up.

      "Equipment: two baking sheets lined with silicon baking sheets; a sturdy ziplock plastic bag; a pair of scissors. Preheat the oven to 420/ F. Cut up the butter, and put it with the water and salt in a pan. Heat over medium heat until the butter has melted. Dump in the flour, and mix vigorously with a wooden spoon, until the flour is completely incorporated. The dough ball should slightly film the pan with a floury residue. Take off the heat and cool the bottom by putting it on a damp kitchen towel, or briefly running cold water over it. Add the eggs, little by little, to the pan, mixing vigorously between additions. It may look like someone threw up at first, but it will all get incorporated. Scoop the warm dough into the plastic bag. Cut the end off one corner with scissors, to make an opening about .5 cm / 1/4 inch or so. Now you will squeeze the mixture onto the pans - the shape dictates what you'll call it eventually. You can make long blobs, which would make them eclairs, tiny blobs, or bigger blobs. To smooth out any parts that stick up when you squeeze out the dough, just wet your finger in water or milk and smooth out. You can also glaze the puffs with a beaten egg wash, to give a shine to it. In this case use a pastry brush, and smooth out the top with it as you glaze. Baking time also varies, depending on how big your blobs are. For about 5 cm diameter / 2 inch puffs, bake for about 20 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through. (Rotating means to switch the pans so that the top one is on the bottom, and vice versa. You may also want to turn the pans at this point too.) Watch the puffs and when they are a medium brown color, take them out. When the puffs are done, immediately slash into each of them with a serrated knife. This lets out the steam and prevents the inside from getting soggy. You can then return the puffs to the oven for a few minutes. To ensure there will be no sogginess whatsoever, some people cut open the puffs and let them dry out a bit in the oven, but I sort of like some softness inside so omit this step. You can also poach the dough in boiling water, to make light gnocchi. Squeeze blobs of the dough into the salted boiling water and cook until the bits float to the surface. Serve with butter, cheese, fresh parsley and so on.\n",

Using a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on med-high speed until the mixture is very light in color--almost white--and the texture is fluffy, about 7 minutes; scrape down the sides of the bowl a few times during the process. Combine the egg whites and vanilla in a liquid measuring cup; with the mixer on medium speed, add the egg whites slowly (about 1/4 cup at a time), completely incorporating each before adding the next; scrape bowl as needed. Note--to me, the author makes the next steps more complicated in her description; here is what I do when adding the dry and wet ingredients-- add flour mixture alternately with milk, beginning and ending with flour mixture (flour, milk, flour, milk, flour). Author's instructions--Decrease mixer speed to low; add 1/3 of the dry ingredients to the mixer and incorporate on low speed, then increase to medium speed. Add 1 cup of the milk and mix briefly to incorporate; reduce speed to low again, add half the remaining dry ingredients, and mix to incorporate, then increase the speed to medium and beat for 1 minute. Repeat with the remaining 1 cup milk and the remaining dry ingredients, but stop mixing just before the flour is fully incorporated. Finish the mixing by hand, using a sturdy spatula and being sure to scrape up from the bottom of the bowl. Pour the batter into the prepared pan; bake for 45 minutes, then rotate the pan, lower oven temperature to 325, and bake for 30 minutes more. It's ready when the sides pull away from the pan slightly and it springs back when pressed lightly in the center; the top will probably split; use a cake tester to check for doneness. Make the glaze while the cake is in the oven--measure the powdered sugar, cream, and vanilla into a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Let the cake cool for 15 minutes before turning it out. Whisk the glaze again until completely smooth, then use it immediately. Saturate the cake completely, using a pastry brush to coat the entire surface.

      "PREPARE: Prewarm the thermometer in hot water; use a 2-quart saucepan; butter the upper sides (inside) of the saucepan; measure all ingredients except the vanilla and optionals, and dump into the saucepan. Grease and if necessary, line a 5 X 10-inch pan. Fill glass with ice cubes and water and the sink with 1/2 inch of cold water. Dissolve the sugar, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon, over low heat until the butter melts, the gritty sounds cease, and the spoon glides smoothly over the bottom of the pan. Increase the heat to medium and bring to a boil. Boil, after washing down any crystals that may have formed, with a pastry brush dipped in hot water from the thermometer bath, using as little water as possible. Introduce the prewarmed thermometer. Reduce the heat while keeping the fudge at a boil. Stir no more than necessary. Test the fudge mixture in the ice-cold water when the mixture thickens and bubbles become noisy. Ball, formed in ice water, should hold its shape until the heat from your had begins to flatten it and should be al dente ~- slightly chewy -- between 230 and 240 (110 and 115 1/2 degrees C.). Shock by placing the saucepan in the cold water in the sink. Seed by adding, without stirring, the vanilla. Then allow to cool. Stir when luke warm and \"skin\" forms on the top (110 degrees F. (43 1/2 degrees C.)). Return the thermometer to its hot water bath to soak clean. Stir the fudge thoroughly but not vigorously by hand, with an electric mixer, or with a food processor. Pause frequently to allow the fudge to react. Watch for the fudge to thicken, lose its sheen, and become lighter in color or streaked with lighter shade, give off some heat, suddenly stiffen. If mixing by had, the fudge will \"snap\" with each stroke; by mixer, mixer waves will become very distinct, by food processor, fudge will flow sluggishly back to the center when the processor is stopped. Add the optionals ( 1/2 Cup Chopped Nuts (walnuts, pecans, or hazelnuts (filberts)) before the fudge totally candies. Pour, score, and store when cool in an airtight container in the refrigerator or at room temperature. YIELD: 1 pound of fudge. Recipe is easily doubled and can be frozen.\n",

Once the dough has chilled, preheat your oven to 350 F and line 2 large baking sheets with parchment paper. Set aside. Unwrap the dough onto a generously floured surface. With a floured rolling pin, roll the dough out to 1/4 of an inch thick. Using the cookie cutter of your choice (floured) cut shapes out of your dough. Place the cookies onto the baking sheet (12 per large baking sheet), spacing them about an inch apart. You can re-roll your scraps of dough to make additional cookies.

Use any nut butter (almond butter is great, but I know, very expensive, and add 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Apple Pie: Use chopped dried apples for the fruit and rice syrup or honey for the syrup.

Using a pastry cutter, cut cold lard into the flour mixture until the dough resembles small peas. Do not overwork. Add 2 tablespoons milk and work into the dough using a fork. Add one or two more tablespoons of milk, working with a fork until the dough pulls together into a nice ball. Divide into two equal pieces and lightly work into disks. Wrap disks individually in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour or up to one day. On a floured work surface, roll out into a 12-inch disk about 1/8 inch thick and place into a pie plate. Fill and bake according to your pie recipe. If a recipe calls for a pre-baked pie crust, pierce evenly around the crust with a fork and bake in a 400 degrees F oven for about 15 minutes or until golden brown.

      "VEGAN This homemade, half whole wheat dough is quick and easy to make, requires only one rising, and makes sufficient dough for two round or possibly one big rectangular pans. A word of warning: Don't knead pizza dough after first rising. This will make it hard to roll out. If you forget and knead, let dough relax, covered, 20 min. Put water in large bowl. Sprinkle in yeast, let soften and whisk to dissolve. Add in salt; stir. Add in flours all at once. Stir to mix with sturdy wooden or possibly stainless steel spoon till flour is incorporated and dough forms ball. Turn out on lightly floured board and knead 5 to 8 min, or possibly till dough is elastic and not sticky, but still soft. Wash and dry bowl; oil lightly. Return dough to bowl. Cover with clean damp towel. Let rise in hot place (85 degrees) till doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Turn out dough on lightly floured board. For two pizzas, divide dough in half with knife or possibly dough cutter. Roll into 14- inch circles. Ease into lightly oiled 14-inch round pizza pans which have each been sprinkled lightly with 2 tsp. cornmeal. Or possibly, roll out entire dough to fit 1 cookie sheet which has been lightly oiled and dusted with 4 tsp. cornmeal. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Top pizza as desired with sauce and toppings. Bake about 15 min, or possibly till dough is completely baked and toppings are cooked through. Makes 2 thin 14-inch round crusts, 1 10-by 15-inch rectangular crust or possibly the top and bottom crusts for a 12-inch stuffed pizza.\n",

Bake until the peaches are starting to soften and release their juices, about 15 to 20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the topping. Whisk together the flour, 3 tablespoons of the sugar, the baking powder, and baking soda in a large bowl to combine. Add the butter and toss with your fingers until well coated in the flour mixture. Using a pastry blender or 2 knives, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until reduced to pea-size pieces, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add the buttermilk or yogurt and stir until a soft, crumbly dough forms. Divide the dough into 9 equal portions. Form each portion into a 2-inch-wide patty and place on a large plate. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside. When the peaches are ready, remove the baking dish from the oven, stir to coat the peaches in the juices, and arrange in an even layer again. Place the dough patties in a single layer on top. Sprinkle the remaining tablespoon of sugar evenly over the top of the cobbler. Bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the filling is bubbling around the edges, about 15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and let cool for at least 20 minutes before serving.\n",

Sprinkle in enough of the water (mixing it lightly with a fork) to moisten all the flour and make a dough that you can form into a ball. Flatten the dough into a circle about 1/2-inch thick On a lightly floured board or a sheet of waxed paper, roll the dough into a thin (about 1/8 inch) circle about 11 inches diameter. Line a 9-inch pie pan with the dough and trim the edges to leave a 1/2-inch overhang all around. Use the overhang to form a fluted edge. Place the crust in the freezer for at least 20 minutes. Fill the shell and bake it according to the directions of your specific recipe. *To bake the crust without a filling; Preheat the oven to 425F. Line the prepared pie crust with aluminum foil and place it on a baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes. Remove it from the oven and discard the foil. Bake for 7 minutes.

      "Deflate the butter roll dough after its 1st rising is done. Put the dough in a plastic bag, and rest it for an hour in the refrigerator. Roll the salted butter into a 15 cm square flat piece, and chill it in the refrigerator. Roll the rested bread dough from Step 1 out, and wrap it around the chilled butter from Step 2. Pinch the seams tightly closed. Roll this out while dusting it with flour, and then fold into thirds. Wrap in plastic and chill it in the freezer (not the refrigerator) for 5 minutes. Repeat 2 more times. While the dough is chilling, prepare the molds. Cut foil into about 22 cm square pieces and stack them. Place a 10 cm diameter circular mold (or a deep dish) on top, and wrap the foil around it, folding any bits that stick out inside. The molds are done. Brush the molds thinly with oil (if you forget this the cakes will stick and won't come out!!). Cut the topping butter into small pieces, and put the butter pieces and the granulated sugar into the foil molds. Roll the well chilled dough out thinly, and divide into 6 pieces lengthwise. (You'll end up with 6 thin ropes.) Twist each rope with both hands, and coil into the oiled foil molds in a spiral shape. Mist the rolls lightly with a water sprayer. Leave in a warm place for about an hour to rise. In the wintertime leave them in a heated room. I don't recommend using the bread proofing setting of an oven since the temperature is too high and the butter will melt out. Preheat the oven to 200C. When the dough has finished rising, sprinkle them with granulated sugar (not included in the ingredient list). Bake the rolls once the oven has reached temperature for 22 to 23 minutes. If the tops have become dark brown, the bottoms should be caramelized, too. Take the rolls out immediately, and cool them upside down. They'll be piping hot, so be sure to protect your hands with oven gloves or something. Let them cool down completely so that the caramelized bits can become crunchy before eating. The main photo shows them after they've cooled down, with the caramelized tops facing up.\n",

      "Toast the coconut: Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread the coconut in an even layer on the baking sheet and toast, tossing and turning every 4 minutes or so, until the coconut just starts to turn golden, about 12 minutes total. Remove the coconut from the oven and set aside to cool. Make the Cookie Base: Increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Lightly spray a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line it with parchment paper, allowing the parchment to overhang on two sides. Lightly spray the parchment paper. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until fluffy, approximately 2 minutes. Add the vanilla and the flour mixture and beat just until combined. Turn the dough out into the prepared baking pan and, with lightly floured hands, press the dough into an even layer on the bottom of the pan (do not press up the sides). Prick the top of the dough with the tines of a fork and bake the crust for 25 to 30 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through the baking time, until golden. Remove the pan from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Make the Caramel Layer: In a medium saucepan, combine the corn syrup, both sugars, and 2 tablespoons of water and stir gently so you dont splash any of it up on the sides of the pan. Set the saucepan over low heat and continue to stir gently until the sugar dissolves. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, making sure the bulb of the thermometer is immersed in the syrup. Turn the heat up to medium-high and wait without stirring for the mixture to reach 240 to 245 degrees F, about 7 minutes. Keep a watchful eye on the temperature while you proceed with the next stepyou do not want the mixture to exceed 250 degrees F. Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over medium heat, stir together the cream and sweetened condensed milk. Gently warm the mixture; do not let it boil. Once the sugar mixture turns amber, remove it from the heat and stir in the butter and the warm cream mixture until completely combined (be careful as it will bubble up when you add the cream mixture). Place the pan back over medium heat, stop stirring, and bring the mixture back to 245 to 250 degrees F. Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and fold in 2 cups of the toasted coconut. Pour the caramel directly onto the cookie base and, working quickly, spread it into an even layer with an offset spatula. Sprinkle the remaining 1 cup of toasted coconut over the caramel. Let cool to room temperature, about 2 hours, then place in the refrigerator to chill for at least 1 hour. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a knife to loosen the chilled bars from the sides of the pan, then lift the bars out using the parchment paper overhang. Spray a sharp knife with nonstick cooking spray and cut the bars into twenty-four 3-by-1 1/2-inch rectangles and place on the prepared baking sheet. Refrigerate until ready to assemble. Assemble the bars: Melt both chocolates together in the bowl of a double boiler over medium heat or in the microwave (in a microwave-safe bowl, cook the chocolate at 50% power (medium) for 15-seconds bursts, stirring between each blast, until melted). Dip half of each individual bar in the melted chocolate, scrape off the excess chocolate with an offset spatula, and place the bar back on the baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining bars. Alternatively, dip the bottom of each bar in the remaining melted chocolate, scrape off the excess chocolate with an offset spatula. Return to the baking sheet to set. Once set, squeeze the chocolate into one corner of the zippered plastic bag and twist the other end of the bag a few times to form a makeshift pastry bag. Use a kitchen scissor to snip off the small corner of the bag where the chocolate has collected (you dont want too large a snip or the chocolate will ooze out). Working quickly, drizzle the chocolate in a zigzag pattern across all of the bars. Place the pan of bars back into the refrigerator for 15 minutes to let the chocolate set up. Serve immediately. The bars can be stored in the refrigerator, tightly covered, for up to 4 days. They taste really good directly from the refrigerator as well as at room temperatureentirely up to you.\n",

Put Step 1 into a bowl, and add in the A ingredients and B ingredients apart from each other (as if dividing them with the flour from Step 1). Pour the lukewarm water over the B ingredients. Mix with a rubber spatula until everything has come together, and knead by hand. It's very sticky to start with, but it will become firmer if you keep kneading. When the dough has become glossy, it's ready. Divide the dough into 4 pieces and roll into balls, tucking the cut ends inside. Place them on a baking tray. (Shape into your desired style.) Pour hot water in a tea cup, and place in an empty space on the baking tray (to maintain the humidity). Let the dough rise for 40 minutes to 1 hour at 35-40C. Bake for about 15 minutes in an oven preheated to 180-200C. (If you mist the dough with a water sprayer before baking, the crust will be crispy.) When they are baked, let cool on a rack, and they are done. (Cover with a foil, if they look like they are going to burn.) Soy flour bread is easy to brown, so keep an eye on it when you're baking with it for the first time. By doing so, you won't fail baking it, and it's easier to adjust the baking time. If you shape it long and thin, it will be just like grissini bread sticks. If you proof the dough twice as normal, it won't puff up much while baking. So the bread will turn out dense and heavy. It's easier to remove the dough from the bowl with a scraper or spatula.\n",

Strain for 30 minutes over a. bowl or into the sink (liquid is discarded). After the 30 minutes, rinse under cold water and shake the strainer a few times to lose some of that water. Let drain another 5 minutes or so. Meanwhile, heat cider vinegar and sugar in a small saucepan, over medium heat just until sugar is dissolved. Add oil and stir; set aside. In a large bowl, combine garbanzo beans, zucchini, and drained and strained vegetables. Pour vinegar mixture over and mix. Cover and refrigerate overnight. In the morning stir and recover.

Strain the mixture into the bowl with the chocolate, let the mixture stand for 1 minute, then blend together thoroughly with a rubber spatula, whisk, or immersion blender. Add the rum and vanilla, and stir to blend well. Cover the truffle cream, let cool to room temperature, and chill in the refrigerator until thick but not stiff (4 to 6 hours). Or let the truffle cream sit at room temperature for several hours or overnight until completely set and thick. Place the truffle cream in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat at medium speed until the mixture thickens and forms light peaks (about 1 minute). Do not beat too long or the mixture will curdle and become grainy. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Fit a 12-inch pastry bag with a large, plain round pastry tip with a 1/2-inch opening and fill partway with the truffle cream. Holding the pastry bag 1 inch above the paper, pipe out mounds about 1 inch in diameter. Or use a small ice cream scoop to form the mounds. Cover the mounds with plastic wrap and chill in the freezer for 2 hours or in the refrigerator for 6 hours. Dust your hands with confectioners sugar and roll the mounds into balls. These will be the truffle centers. Cover and chill the centers for another 2 hours in the freezer. Remove the truffle centers from the freezer and bring to coolroom temperature so the outer coating wont crack when they are dipped. Line 2 more baking sheets with parchment or waxed paper. Melt and temper the remaining 1 1/2 pounds chocolate (see pages 2530). Place a truffle center into the tempered chocolate, coating it completely. With a dipper or fork, remove the center from the chocolate, carefully shake off the excess chocolate, and turn the truffle out onto the paper. After dipping 4 truffles, sprinkle a pinch of shredded coconut on top of each truffle before the chocolate sets up. Let the truffles set up at room temperature, or chill them in the refrigerator for 10 to 15 minutes. When the truffles are set, place them in paper candy cups. In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the truffles will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. The truffles are best served at room temperature. Instead of dipping the truffle centers in chocolate, roll them in a small bowl of confectioners sugar or shredded unsweetened coconut as soon as they are formed into balls.\n",

      "Proof yeast in warm water. Add brown sugar, salt and applesauce to yeast. Place flours and wheat gluten into the bowl of a large food processor. (Check your food processor manual to make sure your processor is powerful enough to process bread dough and to determine how much flour your processor can handle. If necessary, process this recipe in two batches). I use a 14 cup Cuisinart processor. If you use regular white flour instead of bread flour, add an additional 2 tablespoons of wheat gluten. If you want to use all whole wheat flour, add 4 to 6 more Tablespoons of wheat gluten. (Note: vital wheat gluten is available in bulk or boxes at health food stores). Start processor and slowly pour liquid through the feed tube. You may need more or less liquid depending on the type of flour and the humidity. Within about 30 to 60 seconds the mixture should form a ball. If it doesn't, add more water or flour (whichever is necessary) for the dough to form a ball. After the dough forms a ball, process for an additional 30 to 60 seconds until smooth and elastic. Do not overprocess because processing causes the dough to heat up and it might heat up so much that you kill the yeast. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and form into a ball. This is your opportunity to ensure that the dough has the proper ratio of flour to liquid. Place dough into a lightly oiled bowl and turn to coat the surface of the dough with the oil. Cover with kitchen towel or plastic wrap and let rise in warm place until doubled. Turn risen dough out onto lightly floured board and knead a few times. Cut dough in half and let rest for 10 minutes. Roll half of dough into a rectangle about 1/2 inch thick. Turn board so long edge of rectangle is facing you. Fold right half over middle and press with fingers to seal. Fold left half over middle (so the \"new rectangle\" is as wide as your bread pan) and seal. Roll (beginning at narrow side) tightly, pressing with fingers to seal well. Pinch ends and tuck under loaf. Place in a greased loaf pan (8 inches by 4 1/4 inches by 2 1/2 inces). Oil the top of the loaf. Cover with a kitchen towel or loose plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled. Bake at 325 degrees F until done. This takes about 27 minutes in my oven.

Bake in preheated oven for 8-10 minutes or until lightly golden. Remove from oven and reduce oven temperature to 160C To make the caramel filling, combine the condensed milk, golden syrup and butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes or until mixture is smooth. Pour evenly among the muffin pans. Bake for 5-7 minutes or until golden brown and filling sets. Remove from oven and set aside to cool. Use a small, sharp knife to carefully run around the edge of each pan to remove caramel cups. Transfer to a wire rack. Place chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water (don't let the base of the bowl touch the water). Stir until chocolate melts. Remove from heat.

      "Pour the yeast and 1/2 c. of the water in the bowl of your mixer. Let proof about 5-10 minutes. Meanwhile, mix the flours, the salt and sugar together. When the yeast has proofed, pour in the remaining 2 c. water, and 1/2 the flour mixture, and with the dough hook attachment, mix on med-low speed, stopping to scrape down the sides occasionally until all is combined. Add the remaining flour and mix on very low speed until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. This could take a while. If the dough requires more flour, use bread flour. Add the butter, a tablespoon at a time, and mix until incorporated. Don't freak out if your dough comes apart with the addition of the butter. Continue to mix it and after a while, it will come back together. Either continue to knead in your machine until smooth and elastic, or remove from the mixer and knead by hand (I always do the last 5-10 minutes of kneading by hand. ). Put the dough into a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap then a towel, and set aside to rise (about 2- 3 hours- this dough seems to be slow to rise, but that's okay- slow rise is better than fast rise.) At this point, you could refrigerate the dough overnight before proceeding to panning. Once the dough has more than doubled in bulk, punch it down and divide into two loaves. Place the dough into greased loaf pans, and set aside to rise again. I have noticed that this tends to take at least 1 1/2 hours, maybe 2. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. When the loaves are ready, pop them in the oven and bake until done, about 45-50 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool before wrapping. *Note:You can certainly use regular wheat flour, but I've been using King Arthurs White Whole Wheat flour. If you can get it, give it a try. Great flavor. You can substitute AP flour for the bread flour, but your texture will be different. Bread flour gives this bread a much more sturdy texture and a better form.\n",

      "Position a rack in the bottom third of the oven and preheat to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, microwave 4 tablespoons butter and the maple syrup at high power until melted, 30 seconds; stir. In a small bowl, stir together 1/3 cup granulated sugar, the brown sugar and the cinnamon. In a food processor, combine the flour, baking powder, the remaining 2 tablespoons granulated sugar and the salt; pulse to combine. Cut the remaining 1 stick chilled butter into small pieces and pulse with the flour mixture until coarse crumbs form. Pulse in the buttermilk until the dough just comes together. Transfer to a lightly floured work surface; pat into a 10-inch square (the dough will be sticky). Quarter the dough, then cut each quarter into 16 equal pieces; roll into balls. Dip each ball in the maple butter, then coat with the sugar mixture. Place 5-6 coated balls into each cup of a muffin pan coated with cooking spray and press to compact. Bake until cooked through and golden, 15-17 minutes (tent with foil if the tops darken too quickly). Transfer the muffin pan to a rack and cool for 10 minutes. Using a knife loosen the sides of the monkey bread; invert onto a platter then turn right side up. Serve warm. You could also drizzle the minis with frosting made by combining 1 cup powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons milk.\n",

      "Press the tofu to drain out the excess water for about 30 minutes. Just leave it to drain because you don't have to be careful about it. In a bowl, add in everything from the flour down to the salt and have it on standby. (Keep the salt and yeast separated.) Pour in the yeast and then the tofu that's been warmed up a bit in the microwave! Knead with your hands using the natural heat from it. (It should take about 10 minutes.) When you are done kneading it by hand, cover it with a tightly wrung out damp towel and then let the dough rest for 10-15 minutes. While you are waiting, start to preheat your oven to 400F (200C). Then in a frying pan, add in the honey and then boil in plenty of water. Next take the dough and divide it then form the dough into bagel shapes. This time you can make it into heart shapes or the standard round shape. Let each side of the dough sit in the boiling water for 30 seconds and then bake it for 15-17 minutes and it's done! How to make the heart shape I divided the dough into three portions and rolled out the dough slightly with a rolling pin. While leaving just the top uncut, cut most of the dough in half with a kitchen knife. Bring the two cut ends together and seal the seam tightly. Now form the dough into a heart shape. Anyway, I guess you could say that \"closing the seam nice and tightly\" is the ultimate rule of making these tofu bagels. If it expands and loses the heart shape it's a little depressing, so don't fail to close the seam tightly. I baked these. Two heart shaped ones and one regular one. This regular tofu bagel had a heart-shaped hole in the center! Check it out for tips. I made them with matcha too! Check out.\n",

Flip and fry the other side until golden brown. Measure two cups of fresh or frozen berries. Slice strawberries if using and heat frozen berries. Top each serving of pancakes with berries and enjoy!

      "1. In a bowl add your almonds, vanilla, honey (or maple syrup), cocoa powder, sea salt, and boiling hot water. Mix together and cover tightly with a lid or plastic wrap. Allow it to sit on the counter for 4 hours. 2. Next, add your bowl of soaked almonds and flavored water to a high-powered blender or food processor. Puree on high until frothy, white, and creamy, about 2-3 minutes. 3. Pour the entire mixture into a large bowl and add the remaining cool filtered water (add more than the listed amount, depending on how sweet you want your chocolate milk to be). I suggest starting with the listed amount of water, finishing the recipe, and then tasting. If its too sweet for your liking, simply add another cup or so of filtered water at the end. Whisk and stir together, making sure to really break up the almond puree that was created while blending. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes. 4. While that is resting, get out another large bowl and add a fine mesh sieve. This will catch most of your almonds. For a smoother milk, you can line your sieve with cheesecloth. If you need some pictures to help you understand better, click on the related blog link. 5. Slowly pour or spoon your almond mixture through the sieve (and cheesecloth, if using) into your large bowl. When all the liquid has been added, press your almond meal with a spatula against the sieve, to get out even more liquid. I did this with a rubber spatula and just gently but firmly pressed over and over all around the almonds. Youll be surprised how much more liquid is in those babies! 6. When you feel youve adequately pressed, get out a clean/dry tea towel and dump your almond solids into it. Remove the cheesecloth (and discard) if you used one and wrap up the towel like a package. Over your bowl of milk, squeeze, squeeze, squeeze and twist your towel! Yep, even more liquid will come out! I had my husband do this part because hes way stronger than I am! Note: Do not discard those almond solids! Place them into an airtight container and store in the fridge or freezer to use later. How do you use them? Add to cooked oatmeal or make into oatmeal itself by pouring hot water or (gasp) almond milk over it! Sweeten as desired. You can also use it in your granola, puree into smoothies, or add a yummy nutty kick to your pancake or waffle batter with a few tablespoons added! 7. Finally, carefully pour your milk into a pitcher and store in the fridge for up to one week! Make sure you shake before using each time. Yum! Makes 6-7 cups.\n",

      "Stir together the flour and salt with a fork to blend. Cut the fat into the flour using a food processor, pastry blender, or 2 knives. (For pies with liquid fillings like custard or cooked fruit fillings that are thickened with cornstarch or tapioca, the bits of fat should be evenly small, and the mixture should resemble a coarse meal. This will result in a mealy pie crust, which is less likely to become soggy as the pie bakes. For pies to be filled with fruit or another nonliquid filling, leave some bits of fat in larger pieces, about the size of a small pea, for a crisp and flaky texture in the baked crust.) Drizzle a few tablespoons of the ice water over the surface of the flour mixture and quickly rub the water into the flour. Continue to add the water, a tablespoon or so at a time, just until it holds together when you press a handful of it into a ball. The dough should be evenly moist, not wet, and shaggy or rough in appearance. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Gather and press the dough into a ball, wrap well, and let chill in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Unwrap the dough, place it on a lightly floured work surface, and scatter a little flour over the top. Alternatively, place the dough between sheets of parchment or waxed paper. Roll out the dough for the bottom crust of a pie into an even round about 13 inches in diameter (for a 9-inch pie pan). It should be about 1/8 inch thick. Fold the dough in half or roll it loosely around the rolling pin, and gently lift and position it over the pan. Unfold or unroll and ease the dough into the pan without stretching, making sure that the pan sides and the rim are evenly covered. Press the dough gently against the sides and bottom. Trim the overhang to 1 inch. Tuck the dough overhang under itself and flute the edges. Fill and bake the pie according to recipe directions. Pie doughs may be soft and difficult to roll either because they are too warm, a little too much water has been added to the dough, or the weather is humid. Using marble pastry boards and rolling pins, which stay cooler than the surrounding air, helps to keep pastry dough cool and easy to handle. Another trick to working with pie dough is to roll out the dough between two pieces of parchment or waxed paper. This technique can be a big help to the novice baker.\n",

      "Note: use specialty M&Ms to make it festive for your occasion, like red and green for Christmas, or your favorite teams colors for a Superbowl party. Pop popcorn and allow to cool. You may want to shake out the popcorn into a bowl to get all the unpopped seeds out. In a very large bowl, place M&Ms, peanuts and popcorn in that order, with M&Ms on the bottom, peanuts on top of the M&Ms, and popcorn on top of that. In a saucepan over medium heat, begin melting margarine and add oil and stir. Add in marshmallows and begin stirring while allowing the marshmallows to melt. Stir constantly with a heat-proof spatula/spoonula. Allow to boil until approximately 230 degrees F. The mixture will be translucent when coating the thermometer or against the bottom of the pan when you tilt it to the side. You can do all of the above in the microwave. Just be very careful about the marshmallows expanding and spilling over your bowl. Once the marshmallow mixture is finished cooking, pour it over the popcorn. With two wooden spoons, mix the hot marshmallow mixture into the popcorn and gradually incorporate the peanuts and M&Ms at the bottom of the bowl as the mixture cools a bit. Mix until all the ingredients are evenly distributed. (Or until at least mostly evenly distributed.) Lightly spray an angel food cake pan (or Bundt) and your hands with cooking spray. Using your hands, press the popcorn mixture down into the pan. This recipe will completely fill an angel food cake pan and fill a Bundt pan with a little left over. Allow the pressed cake to cool in the pan for a while (maybe 30 minutes to an hour) until the cake has set and firmed up. Turn cake out on a platter or cake taker that can be covered. You may have to lightly squeeze the pan to release it or you may use a hair-dryer on the outside of the pan to warm and release it. Continue to allow the cake to sit out and set up in the open air at room temperature for another hour or so. Use a sharp bread knife to slice the cake and eat it with your fingers. And eat some more ... and some more ... you get the idea.\n",

Spread a thin layer on ribs and pre-marinated chicken and rub in well. For the chicken, we apply it under the skin on top and bottom and in the cavity. Get intimate with the meat and don't be afraid to get dirty. 4. Place in plastic bags and remove as much air as you can and leave in the fridge overnight. 5. Heat your smoker to 200-225 and smoke for 3.5 hours, adding wood chunks as needed. I soak them first but I don't think it makes much difference. 6. Brush on your favorite sauce (or not) and wrap in foil and smoke for another 1.5 hours. (Try a spicy raspberry sauce for a nice change. ).\n",

Add 1 1/4 cups cream, and mix to a soft dough. Knead the dough for one minute on a lightly floured pastry board, then roll it out to about 1/2-inch thickness. Using a 3-inch biscuit cutter, cut an even number of rounds - 2 rounds per serving. Use a little of the butter to grease a baking sheet. Place half the rounds on it. Melt remaining butter and brush a little on the rounds; place remaining rounds on top. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven, and pull shortcakes apart.

SUGARED ALMONDS: In a small saucepan, combine almonds, sugar and water. Cook over medium-low heat for 5 to 7 minutes or until sugar is almost completely melted and nuts are golden, stirring occasionally- (there will be unmelted sugar on nuts). Spread almonds on a large plate; let cool and then break into small pieces. (Make ahead, as nuts can be stored in an air-tight container for about 3 days). DRESSING: In a small bowl, whisk together balsamic vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, honey, poppy seeds and chives. Drizzle in olive oil and whisk until blended. Now whisk in Dijon mustard until well blended. Whisk in salt and pepper to taste. Remove spinach leaves from water, pat dry on paper towelling and break into pieces. Add to a large mixing bowl. Add sliced strawberries and toss lightly to mix. Add dressing and toss gently until spinach and berries are lightly coated. Add almonds, toss lightly and serve. TIP: Packaged ready-to-use baby spinach can be found in the produce section of most supermarkets. There are 8 cups of baby spinach in (one- 6 ounce) package. NOTE: Only make enough salad that will be eaten at this one time serving. The salad will get somewhat soggy if kept for another day.\n",

With a pastry blender, work the butter into the flour, aiming for pieces of butter that range in size from bread crumbs to small peas. The smaller pieces will make the dough tender; the larger ones will make it flaky. Sprinkle the cold sour cream mixture over the dough, one tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork to evenly distribute it. After youave added all of the sour cream, the dough should be moist enough to stick together when pressed; if itas not, add additional cold water, one teaspoon at a time. (Temptation will be to add too much water; this is not a wet dough.) With your hands, gather the curds of dough together.

Drop the butter pieces into the bowl and pulse eight to ten times, or until the mixture is speckled with pieces of butter that vary in size from bread crumbs to peas. With the machine running, add the sour cream mixture and process just until the dough forms soft, moist curds.

      "3) Make the brine in a large non-reactive pot (stainless, ceramic, porcelain, or glass). You can make it days in advance and keep it chilled if you wish. Add the hot water to a one cup measuring cup. Then pour in salt, any salt, until the water line reaches 3/4 cup. The water will swallow up almost exactly 1/4 pound regardless of whether you use table salt, kosher salt, pickling salt, or sea salt. The volume of these salts may differ, but their water displacement will be the same! Pour the slurry into a very clean non-reactive container large enough to hold the meat and 1/2 gallon of water. Then add the sugar, garlic, and black pepper. Stir until most of the sugar is dissolved. The garlic and pepper will not dissolve much at first. Then add the cold water. 4) Chose your brining container carefully. It needs to be food grade, large enough to hold the meat and the brine with the meat submerged, and it cannot be made of aluminum, copper, or cast iron, all of which can react with the salt. Do not use garbage bags or a garbage can or a bucket from Home Depot. They are not food grade. Do not use a styrofoam cooler. It might give the meat an off flavor and you'll never get the cooler clean when you're done. Zipper bags work fine. For large cuts get Reynolds Brining Bags, Ziploc XL, and XXL bags. If you brine in a zipper bag, periodically grab the bag and squish things around and flip the meat so the brine can get in from all sides. Place the bag in a roasting pan to catch leaks. You can also use bowls, pots, and Tupperware. Submerge the fish skin side up in the brine and refrigerate. Make sure the meat part is thoroughly submerged. If you need to, hold it under with a plate with a weight on top. Cover with plastic wrap not aluminum foil. Gently stir the container occasionally to make sure all parts of the fish come into contact with the brine. 5) The length of brining will vary depending on how thick the filets are. Brine 2\" thick filets for about 2 hours in the fridge, 1\" filets for 1 hour. Drain the fish and discard the brine. Then rinse the fish to remove surface salt, and soak them in clear water for about an hour. This helps get rid of excess salt. Pat dry with paper towels. Some folks like to put the filets in the fridge for an up to 3 hours under the theory that a desirable shiny tacky film or pellicle will form on the surface. It is said to help retain moisture and smoke. I have tried it with and without pellicle and see no quality difference. But a few hours of resting will help the brine to distribute itself evenly through the flesh. 6) Cut pieces of paper bag or plain white paper about the same size as each hunk of fish and place the fish on the paper, skin side down. Don't use foil or parchment paper. We want the fish to stick to the paper to help us remove the skin, and it will not stick to foil or parchment. If you are glazing, sprinkle some brown sugar on top of the fillets or paint them with maple syrup. Place the fish on a rack on your grill or smoker so they are not touching each other. Insert a digital thermometer temperature probe into the thickest part of the thickest fillet. 7) Put the fish into a preheated smoker at about 225F and place the fillet with the probe in the coolest part of the smoker. Add the wood. 8) As the meat approaches doneness, bubbles of milky liquid will often come to the surface. This is a natural protein liquid from within the muscle fibers and it's fine. It just looks ugly. You can wipe it off or brush it off with a wet brush. Remove the meat when it is at about 140F internal. No more than 150F. Total cooking time will be about 60 minutes depending on the actual temperature of your oven and the thickness of the meat. 9) Remove the fillets and let them cool for about 15 minutes, until you can handle them. Then peel off the paper and the skins should come right off with it. While you are looking at the skin side, if there is any dark brown flesh, scrape it off with a serrated steak knife and discard it. It can taste muddy.\n",

Pour syrup over oats and stir until oats and nuts are coated. 5. Divide mixture among the two pans and spread into a thin, even layer. 6. Bake for about 45 minutes, or until golden and a bit crispy. (You can stir the mixture occasionally so that it browns more evenly and the nuts dont burn. I also rotate my pans between oven racks a few times during the baking process.) 7.

Imagine a single dried cranberry cut into about 4 pieces: thats your goal. Preheat the oven to 350F Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets. Whisk together the flour/cranberry mixture, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Add the vanilla and butter, mixing until the butter is thoroughly distributed, but some pea-sized chunks still remain. Dribble in the milk while mixing; the dough will become cohesive. Place the coarse sugar and tart and sour flavor in a jar, and shake to combine thoroughly. Pour the sugar into a roomy plastic bag; about 1/2-gallon size should do. Using a teaspoon cookie scoop (or a spoon), scoop the dough by 1 3/4-teaspoonfuls (about 1 1/4\" balls) into the bag, 6 or 8 at a time. Close the top of the bag, and gently shake to coat the balls with sugar. Place them on the prepared baking sheet, and use the bottom of a glass to flatten them to about 1/4\" thick (about 1 1/2\" in diameter). Repeat with the remaining dough. Bake the cookies for 16 to 17 minutes, until theyre set and barely, BARELY beginning to brown around the very edge; the tops shouldnt be brown at all.

Once it has reached the boiling point stir it regularly until it reaches the desired temperature. When you get to the right temperature, remove from the heat and mix in the vanilla. Let it cool for around 10 minutes and then beat it thoroughly until it starts to thicken. You'll see it start to go a bit grainy at the edges. It might take about 10 minutes. Pour around a third of your mixture into your tin. Leave it for a few minutes, then top with half your chocolate, and half your cherries if you're using them. Add another layer of fudge and repeat until you've finished. Leave to set for about twenty minutes. Score into 32 pieces. Leave to cool completely and cut through properly.

      "All measurements are by weight. If you don't have a scale, here are alternative measurements: Bread flour - 3 cups Salt - 2 1/2 teaspoons Yeast - 1/4 oz package of Rapid Rise Yeast (If you use this type, you will NOT have to mix with warm water first.) Water - 1 1/2 cups Ok, now for the bread. Put the flour in a bowl. Add the salt and mix thoroughly. Add yeast and mix thoroughly. Add water and mix until incorporated. (Your hands will work fine for this.) Cover the bowl and let rise for for 20 minutes. Fold the dough: Scrape dough into floured surface. Pick up top edge and stretch/pull/fold the dough down about 2/3 and pat down. Pull the bottom edge up to the top of the fold and pat. Pull one side over 2/3 and pat. Pull other side to the edge of the fold and pat. Place back in bowl and cover. Allow to rise another 20 minutes. Fold dough again. Notice that the gluten is starting to develop nicely and the dough is smoothing out. Allow to rise another 20 minutes. Fold one last time. Notice the gluten has developed further. This is how we get away without a mixer or kneading the dough a lot. (Actually, kneading/mixing french too much makes for poorer bread.) Allow to rise for 2 hours. This is a good time for that nap you've been wanting. Divide the bread. This will make 28 ounces of dough. Which is about 10 rolls, 2 baguettes, 3 boules, or 1 sandwich loaf. Today I will be making some rolls, a boule, and and will figure some other shape for the rest, maybe a peasant/batard sort of thing. So that's three pieces of dough: 1/2, 2/3 of the other half, and the scrap. Ball or boule the pieces of dough, place on a floured surface, cover and allow to rise for 40 minute. Cut the rolls into 5 pieces, shape into balls, place on a cornmeal dusted cookie sheet. (DO NOT use cornmeal mix, it has baking powder, flour, and salt added and will burn. You can use rice flour if cornmeal is not available in your area.) Ball up the boule now and place on a heavily cornmealed surface. Shape the scrap too. Cover and allow to rise until doubled. This will depend on the temp in your kitchen, but will be around 1 hour for the boule, 40 minutes or so for the scrap, and 25 minutes for the rolls. The temperature today here is 87F, so I won't be waiting that long. Preheat oven to 450F. Preheat a baker's stone or cookie sheet as well. Just put it in and turn it on. If you use a cookie sheet, you will need to watch for burning with the boule and scrap. For those of you that didn't check out my profile, I live off grid. For now, my oven consists of a Coleman camp stove with a Coleman camp oven. I'm putting up pics so you can see that even with meager equipment, you can make good bread. Slice the top of the rolls with a knife or razor blade and bake until brown, or an internal temp of 180F - 200F Slice, or score, the tops of the boule and scrap, use a turner to transfer to the stone and bake until hollow sounding when thumped on the bottom, or 200F internal temp. Cool on a wire rack. If you can wait....\n",

On lightly wheat-floured surface, roll the dough out to about 1/8-inch thick. If needed, use ice water as \"glue\" to patch it together- It might fall apart a little. Cut into rounds with a large cookie cutter or the top of a glass about 2 1/2\" in diameter. Or you can cut it into squares with a knife. Place on and ungreased baking sheet. Bake until the oatcakes start to brown, about 12-15 minutes. Cool a bit on a wire rack, if your gang will wait that long. To serve, top with whatever you find in your kitchen. These are not sweet, so they make a great base for sweeter toppings like jelly and honey. Other toppings we've use are peanut butter, butter, sliced fruit, cream cheese and coconut.

      "Peel the fresh ginger and slice it as thinly as possible, cutting crosswise against the fibers. Put the ginger slices in a large saucepan, add water to cover, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Decrease the heat to medium-low and simmer for 3 minutes. Drain the ginger and repeat this step twice more. You will have blanched the ginger slices a total of 3 times. After the third draining, return the ginger to the saucepan and attach a candy thermometer to the side. Add the 3 cups (750 ml) water, 3 cups (600 g) sugar, salt, and corn syrup, if using, and cook until the liquid reaches 225F (110C). Remove from the heat and let the ginger rest in the syrup for 1 hour. Place the ginger slices in a strainer and stir a few times to make sure as much syrup drips off as possible. (If you wish, save the syrup for another use, such as for sweetening lemonade or mixing with sparkling water and fresh lime juice.) Spread the ginger slices out on a wire rack set over a baking sheet and allow to dry for 2 to 3 hours. Spread the remaining 1 cup (200 g) sugar on a baking sheet. Place the ginger slices in the sugar and toss with your fingers to separate the pieces and coat them well with sugar. Lift out the slices and shake off the excess sugar with your hands or place them in a colander and shake well. Set the sugar-coated ginger slices on the wire rack and let dry overnight at room temperature. The candied ginger will keep in an airtight container for up to 6 months. The ginger can also be left in its syrup, without draining and tossing in sugar, and kept for a similar length of time in the refrigerator. In the candying process, ginger slices or citrus peels are cooked in a thick sugar syrup to preserve them. But, over time, the sugar has a tendency to recrystallize, causing the ginger or citrus peel to dry out a bit. Adding a bit of corn syrup inhibits this recrystallization. (Most other liquid sweeteners, like honey and maple syrup, dont behave the same way, so theyre not interchangeable for corn syrup.) Ive made the corn syrup optional, so you can decide whether to use it.\n",

      "You will need a large bowl, and unglazed quarry tiles or a baking stone for the next-to-bottom rack of your oven. Place water in a large bread bowl, add yeast, and stir. Add whole wheat flour and 1 cup white flour and stir well, then stir 100 times in the same direction to develop the gluten (one minute). Let this sponge stand for 1/2 hour to 3 hours, covered. Sprinkle salt over the sponge, then add another cup flour and stir. Continue adding flour and stirring until you can stir no longer. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead thoroughly, about ten minutes, until dough is smooth and easy to handle. Clean out bowl, oil lightly, and return dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a convenient place for 2 to 3 hours. When the dough has more than doubled in volume, push down gently and turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into eight equal pieces and shape each into a flat oval shape, approximately 4 inches wide by 8 inches long. Leave these flat disks out on the work surface and cover with plastic wrap to let rise for approximately 20 minutes. Place quarry tiles or large baking stone on a rack in the lower third of your oven, leaving a 1 inch space between the tiles and the oven wall to allow air to circulate. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Five minutes after the oven has preheated, begin shaping the first bread. Place a small bowl full of cold water by the edge of your work surface. Using your fingertips, first dip them in the water and then, beginning at one end of the disk of dough, make tightly spaced indentations all over the surface of the dough, so that it looks pitted, though not pierced through. Now stretch the dough gently into a long oval strip by draping it over both hands and pulling them apart gently. The dough should stretch and give, and after several tries will extend to make a long oval about 12 inches long with attractive stretch marks along it from the stretched indentations (hence, the name \"snowshoe bread\"). Place the bread back on the work surface, sprinkle with a pinch (less than 1/8 teaspoon) of black onion seeds, then using both hands, place the bread directly on heated quarry tiles or stone. While the bread bakes, begin to shape the next bread. Cooking time for each bread is approximately 4 minutes. You will soon develop a rhythm so that you can bake two breads side by side across your oven, one going in when the other is half done. When done, breads will have golden patches on top and a crusty browned bottom surface. To keep breads warm and soft, wrap them in a cotton cloth five minutes after they come out of the oven. Serve warm or at room temperature.\n",

When a ball of dough is formed, put it into a sturdy and large nylong bag. Sandwich the bag between newspapers, and step on the dough over the paper. When the dough is flattened, take it out of the bag, fold it over, put it back in the bag and step on it again. Continue for 20 minutes. Form the dough into a ball again, wrap in plastic wrap and rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. Take the dough out of the plastic wrap and cut it up into single sized portions. Flour the cutting board, rolling pin, your hands and the dough balls with flour or katakuriko, and roll out each portion of dough with the rolling pin. Fold the rolled out dough into thirds, and slice into evenly sized noodles. Dust the cut dough with flour or katakuriko as soon as it's cut to prevent it from sticking, and loosen the noodles. This is how the noodles look after being cut and dusted with flour. If you want to store the noodles, wrap each portion in plastic wrap and refrigerator. It will keep for about 3 days. Bring plenty of water to a boil in a pot. Put in the udon noodles while pulling them apart, and cook them for about 10 minutes. Make sure the water doesn't boil over. Drain the noodles into a colander, cool them well in cold water, and they're done! You can use the noodles as-is to eat cold dipped into a dipping sauce or in other cold noodle dishes.

      "Combine the flour, salt, yeast, and water in a mixing bowl. If using a mixer, use the paddle attachment and mix on the lowest speed for 1 minute. If mixing by hand, use a large spoon and stir for about 1 minute, until well blended. The dough should be coarse and sticky. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes to fully hydrate the flour. If making ciabatta, drizzle the olive oil over the dough; if making mini baguettes, omit the oil. Then mix on medium-low speed using the paddle attachment, or by hand using a large, wet spoon or wet hands, for 1 minute. The dough should become smoother but will still be very soft, sticky, and wet. Use a wet bowl scraper or spatula to transfer the dough to a clean, lightly oiled bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest at room temperature for 10 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface. With wet or oiled hands, reach under the front end of the dough, stretch it out, then fold it back onto the top of the dough. Do this from the back end and then from each side, then flip the dough over and tuck it into a ball. The dough should be significantly firmer, though still very soft and fragile. Place the dough back in the bowl, cover, and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes. Repeat this process three more times, completing all repetitions within 40 minutes. (You can also perform the stretch and folds in the bowl, as shown on page 17.) After the final stretch and fold, immediately cover the bowl tightly and refrigerate overnight or for up to 4 days. The dough will rise, possibly to double its original size, in the refrigerator. (If you plan to bake the dough in batches over different days, you can portion the dough and place it into two or more oiled bowls at this stage.) Remove the dough from the refrigerator about 1 hour before baking for mini baguettes, and 3 hours in advance for ciabatta (or an hour earlier if the dough hasnt increased to 1 1/2 times its original size in the refrigerator overnight). To make ciabatta, about 1 hour after taking the dough out of the refrigerator, line the back of a sheet pan with parchment paper and generously dust the entire surface with flour. Use a wet or oiled bowl scraper to transfer the dough to the work surface, taking care to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid degassing it. Dust the top surface of the dough with flour and also flour your hands. Using your hands or a metal pastry scraper, gently coax and pat the dough into a rough square measuring about 9 inches on each side, still taking care to degas it as little as possible. For small ciabatta, cut the dough into 3 even strips about 3 inches wide and 9 inches long (the pieces will each weigh about 12 ounces or 340 grams). For larger ciabatta, cut the dough in half. With floured hands, gently fold the dough in thirds, like folding a letter but without applying any pressure. Gently roll the folded dough in the dusting flour to coat it, then lift the dough and place it on the parchment paper, again rolling it in the dusting flour on the parchment. Rest the dough seam side down on the parchment and repeat with the other pieces of dough. Mist the tops of the dough pieces with spray oil and loosely cover the pan with plastic wrap or a clean, lint-free towel. After 1 hour, gently roll the pieces over so the seam side is up, lift and cradle each piece with floured hands, and, working from the underside, gently coax it to a length of 5 inches (for small ciabatta) to 7 inches (for large ciabatta). Lay the pieces back on the parchment seam side up. Straighten the sides of each piece with your hands or a pastry scraper so that they are more rectangular than oblong, mist with spray oil again, then cover loosely and proof for 1 hour more. About 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C) or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30). Slide the dough, parchment and all, onto the stone; if you arent using a baking stone, simply put the whole pan into the oven. Pour 1 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 450F (232C). Bake for 12 minutes, then rotate the pan and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the crust is a rich brown (streaked with the dusting flour). The bread should puff a little, and the crust should be hard when tapped (itll soften as it cools). Cool on a wire rack for 45 minutes before slicing. To make mini baguettes, about 45 minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 550F (288C), or as high as it will go, and prepare the oven for hearth baking (see page 30). After the dough has been out for 1 hour, generously dust the entire surface of a wooden peel with flour or line the back of a sheet pan with parchment paper (you can either dust the parchment with flour or mist it with spray oil so that you can slide and move the dough if need be). Use a wet or oiled bowl scraper to transfer the dough from the bowl to the work surface, taking care to handle the dough as little as possible to avoid degassing it. Dust the top surface of the dough with flour and also flour your hands. Using your hands or a metal pastry scraper, gently coax and pat the dough into a rough square about 8 inches on each side, still taking care to degas it as little as possible. Cut off a slice of dough about 1 1/2 inches wide and roll it into the dusting flour to lightly coat it and keep it from sticking to the remainder of the dough. Working with floured hands and tools, carefully transfer the slice to the prepared peel or parchment paper, cradling it with both hands to keep it from stretching too much. You can straighten it by spreading your hands underneath the dough as you lay it down; it should elongate slightly, to 9 to 10 inches. Repeat with the rest of the dough, placing the pieces 1 inch apart, until the peel or parchment is full. If you cant fit all of the pieces on the peel or parchment, bake those that are ready before cutting the remainder. Its better to work in manageable batches than to try to cram all of them in the oven, especially if your stone or oven wont easily hold all of them. Scoring the dough is an option, but because it risks degassing the dough, I advise against it until you have made these a few times. Slide the mini baguettes onto the baking stone using short, quick back-and-forth motions with the peel, or by sliding the parchment paper onto the stone. Pour 1/2 cup of hot water into the steam pan, then lower the oven temperature to 475F (246C). Bake for 12 to 18 minutes total, rotating the pan as needed for even browning. The crust should be a rich brown, the loaves should puff a little, and the crust should be hard when tapped (the crust will soften slightly as the bread cools). Cool on a wire rack for at least 15 minutes. For an interesting ciabatta texture and a nice design on the surface of the bread, mix a small amount of coarse rye flour or whole wheat flour in with the dusting flour.\n",

      "Position the oven racks in the upper-and lower-third shelves and preheat the oven to 375F. Use some of the melted butter to generously grease two cushioned cookie sheets. Reserve any remaining melted butter. Pour 3/4 cup granulated sugar on a doubled paper towel that sits on your counter. Use some of the reserved melted butter to generously grease the bottom of the outside of a wide drinking glass, and plant the buttered surface directly in the sugar, pressing down, and leave it in the sugar until needed. Put four wire cooling racks on your counter and place two long overlapping sheets of waxed paper under two of the racks (these will be for the tops of the cookies). Use an electric mixer with a paddle attachment, or a handheld mixer, to cream the 1 cup softened butter with the remaining 1 cup of sugar until light and creamy. Add the peanut butter and combine well. Turn off the machine and add the flour. With the machine on the lowest setting, mix the dough until fully combined, without overworking it. Form walnut-size balls of dough and place them 1 1/2 inches apart on the prepared cookie sheets. (You should be able to bake 9 to 12 cookies on each sheet, if using a 2 1/2-inch cookie cutter.) Lift the buttered and sugared glass and press down on each ball of dough, flattening it to 1/4 inch thick. After flattening each portion of dough, rub the greased glass in the sugar before flattening the next. (If the sugared surface gets clumpy, wipe it off and reapply some melted butter and sugar.) Use a clean pastry brush to gently remove any excess sugar from the tops of the flattened cookie dough. Use a 2 1/2-inch heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out hearts from the flattened dough. Before removing the cutter, use your finger to remove the excess cookie dough, and place these scraps back in the original bowl. Insert a small cutter or a thimble into half (or a few more) of the shaped cookies and rotate the cutter in a circular motion to widen the hole slightly. Lift out the cutter and, using the pointed tip of a short paring knife, pick the dough out of the hole. Put these pieces of dough back into the bowl with the other scraps. When the cookie sheets are full, transfer them to both levels of the oven and bake for 6 to 9 minutes, switching their positions after half the baking time. Check after 6 minutes. When done, the cookies will be slightly more golden around the edges but the tops should be only a light golden color. Remove the sheets from the oven and place the sheets with cookies with holes on the wire racks set over waxed paper. Place the sheets with uncut cookies on the two other racks and let them all cool for 10 minutes. Using a very thin metal turning spatula, carefully transfer the cookies to their wire racks to cool further. (Wipe off the spatula after removing each cookie from the sheet.) Cool, clean, and grease the cookie sheets and repeat the above procedure until all of the cookie dough has been used. Once completely cool, assemble the sandwiches. First, generously sift the confectioners sugar over the cookies with holes. Lift and turn a hole-free cookie flat side up, and spoon a generous teaspoon of jam in the center. Carefully lift a top sugared cookie and (gently now) lay it, sugared side up, on top of the jam, applying only the slightest bit of wiggling pressure so the jam plumps up through the hole. Place the assembled sandwich cookie back on its rack while you continue to assemble the rest. If serving soon, use a thin metal spatula to transfer the cookies to a decorative serving platter. If serving later in the day of baking, or the next day, carefully transfer the cookies to a deep rectangular container (like a large roasting pan) to protect their appearance. Cover the pan securely with aluminum foil and leave it at room temperature. Chocolate-Filled Hearts: Melt 12 ounces of semisweet or milk chocolate in either the top of a double boiler over barely simmering water, stirring constantly, or in a microwave (uncovered) for 1 minute on high power, stirring after heating until smooth. Apply the chocolate as you would jam to the flat side of a cookie and sandwich them as directed.\n",

Pour this mixture into the tempered chocolate and stir to coat it completely. Pour the chocolate mixture into the flan form and use a rubber spatula to spread it evenly and smoothly. Chill in the refrigerator until slightly set (about 15 minutes). Remove from the refrigerator and score the candy into fourteen 1-inch-wide bars. Score each bar in half to indicate 1 by 2-inch bars. Return the candy to the refrigerator to set completely (about 1 hour). Remove the candy from the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. With a sharp, thin-bladed knife, cut around the rim of the flan form to remove it, then cut the candy into the marked pieces. Place each bar in a paper candy cup. In a tightly covered container wrapped in several layers of aluminum foil, the bars will keep for 1 month in the refrigerator or 2 months in the freezer. They are best served at room temperature. Substitute any nuts for the almonds. Substitute other dried fruits for the candied orange peel and raisins.

Remove from heat and pour into sterilized pint jars. Cover with lids and jar rings and process in a boiling water bath for 10 minutes. * To make berry juice, wash the berries well and put them in a large saucepan. Heat, stirring and mashing, until they are hot and juicy. Press them through a colander, and then strain the juice through a jelly bag or two layers of cheesecloth. (Sometimes the natural pectin content of the berries is so great that this turns to jelly rather than syrup.)\n",

      "For the dough: In a small bowl stir together the sour cream and sugar. Set aside. In a large bowl mix flours and salt. Cut cold butter into into the flour mixture until mixture resembles coarse meal. Using a fork gently toss the sour cream mixture in with the flour mixture. Dough will be very soft. Divide dough into two equal sections. Shape each section of into a rectangle and wrap them in plastic wrap. Refrigerate dough at least 1 hour. Remove one piece of dough from the refrigerator and roll into a 9-inch x 18-inch rectangle between two sheets plastic wrap or parchment paper. Spread the top with a tablespoon of room temperature butter and fold the rectangle of dough in thirds like a business letter. Repeat folding dough in thirds in opposite direction to end with a square. Wrap up the square and refrigerate for 2 hours. Repeat with the remaining section of dough and butter. For the filling: In a medium-sized bowl combine blackberries, sugar and flour. Set aside. If using frozen blackberries set aside until blackberries defrost. For the assembly: Preheat oven to 375 F. Line 2 baking sheets with a Silpat or a sheet of parchment paper. Roll out each piece of dough until its about 1/8-inch thick. Cut out 4 1/2 inch rounds. You can gather scraps, chill and re-roll dough to make additional turnovers. Each piece of dough will yield about 7 or 8 turnovers. Transfer each dough round to a baking sheet and fill with 2 tablespoons of blackberries. Moisten the edge of the dough with a little water on your finger and fold dough in half, using a fork to crimp together the edges of dough. Poke 4 steam holes in the center of each turnover using a fork. Sprinkle each turnover with a pinch of sugar. Bake for 20-30 minutes. Rotate baking sheets 10 minutes into baking. Bake until turnovers are puffed, firm to the touch and golden brown. Remove to a cooling rack. Recipe by Serena Bakes Simply From Scratch adapted from Dorie Greenspan.\n",

      "Stir together the high-gluten flour, whole-wheat flour, sugar (if using), salt, powdered milk, and yeast in a 4-quart mixing bowl (or in the bowl of an electric mixer). Add the shortening, honey (if using), and water. Stir (or mix on low speed with the paddle attachment) until the ingredients form a ball. If there is still flour in the bottom of the bowl, dribble in additional water. The dough should feel soft and supple. It is better for it to be a little too soft than to be too stiff and tough. Sprinkle high-gluten or whole-wheat flour on the counter, transfer the dough to the counter, and begin kneading (or mix on medium speed with the dough hook). Add more flour if needed to make a firm, supple dough that is slightly tacky but not sticky. Kneading should take about 10 minutes (6 minutes by machine). The dough should pass the windowpane test (page 58)and register 77 to 81F. Lightly oil a large bowl and transfer the dough to the bowl, rolling it around to coat it with oil. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Ferment at room temperature for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until the dough doubles in size. Remove the dough from the bowl and press it by hand into a rectangle about 3/4 inch thick, 6 inches wide, and 8 to 10 inches long. Form it into a loaf, as shown on page 81. Place the loaf in a lightly oiled 8 1/2 by 4 1/2-inch bread pan. Mist the top with spray oil and loosely cover with plastic wrap. Proof at room temperature for approximately 90 minutes, or until the dough crests above the lip of the pan. Preheat the oven to 350F with the oven rack on the middle shelf. Place the bread pan on a sheet pan and bake for 30 minutes. Rotate the pan 180 degrees for even baking and continue baking for 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the oven. The finished loaf should register 190F in the center, be golden brown on the top and the sides, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. When the bread is finished baking, remove it immediately from the loaf pan and cool it on a rack for at least 1 hour, preferably 2 hours, before slicing or serving.

      "To mix the dough by hand, combine flour, salt and baking powder in a medium sized mixing bowl and stir well to mix. Cut butter into 1tablespoon pieces and add to dry ingredients. Toss once or twice to coat pieces of butter. Then using your hands or a pastry blender, break the butter into tiny pieces and pinch and squeeze it into the dry ingredients. Keep the mixture uniform by occasionally reaching down to the bottom of the bowl and mixing all the ingredients evenly together. Continue rubbing the butter into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible. Sprinkle the minimum amount of water over the butter and flour mixture and stir gently with a fork the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough, a tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily. To mix the dough in the food processor, combine flour, salt and baking powder in work bowl fitted with metal blade. Pulse 3 times at 1second intervals to mix. Cut butter into 1 tablespoon pieces and add to work bowl. Process, pulsing repeatedly at 1second intervals, until the mixture is fine and powdery, resembles a coarseground cornmeal and no large pieces of butter remain visible about 15 pulses in all. Scatter the minimum amount of water on the butter and flour mixture and pulse 5 or 6 times the dough should begin holding together. If the mixture still appears dry and crumbly, add the remaining water, 1 teaspoon at a time for the smaller quantity of dough,one tablespoon at a time for the larger quantity, until the dough holds together easily. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and form it into a disk (two equal disks for the larger amount of dough). Sandwich the disk(s) of dough between two pieces of plastic wrap and press it into a 6inch circle. Refrigerate the dough until firm, or until you are ready to use it, at least 1 hour.\n",

      "To prepare the dough by hand, combine the flour and salt in a stainless steel bowl, using a pastry knife mix well. Add in the cool butter cubes to the flour and fold in till the mix begins to resemble a mealy mix where the butter forms pea-sized nuggets plainly visible in the flour. Add in only sufficient ice water to pull the dough together. The water should be added to the flour slowly to ensure which only the minimum amount of water is used. Don't over mix the dough. When the dough has been mixed just sufficiently to combine the ingredients, form it into a ball and wrap in a piece of plastic and chill for several hrs. When ready to use, lightly flour a pastry board and a rolling pin, and unwrap the dough. Divide the dough into 2 equal pcs and begin to roll out the first piece into the bottom crust. Tamp down the dough with the pin and gently begin to roll out into a circular pie shape by rolling proportionately outward from the center and turning the dough in small 1/8th turns to keep the rolling even. When the dough is rolled out to an even thickness and is about 12 inches and is about 1/8th-inch thick it is ready to be transferred to a 10-inch pie tin. Lightly butter the tin, lift the dough with the rolling pin by partially rolling the dough up on the pin, center the dough in the tin and unroll. Pierce it in several places with the tines of a fork. Roll the second half of the pie dough into a round shape slightly larger than the pie pan. Fill the bottom crust with your chosen fruit filling. Cover the filling, such as apple, with the top half of the pie dough. Using both hands, crimp the edges of the two crusts together to seal. With a sharp knife, make several crosshatch slits in the top crust. Brush with an egg wash and bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 35 to 40 min. Remove from the oven and cold for 20 min. This recipe yields two 12-inch pie crusts.\n",

When you are ready to eat the chia pudding, thaw the mangoes by immersing them in very warm water (the water should not be burning hot). Ten minutes was long enough to thaw the mangoes for me. Puree the mangoes in a food processor or blender. 4. Mix the pureed mango and chia pudding together. 5. Serve chilled and top the pudding with your favorite toppings!\n",

      "Line a baking sheet with a nonstick mat or grease it, and lightly grease an offset metal spatula (so that the brittle will be easier to spread). Combine the sugar, water, corn syrup, and butter in a heavy pot over medium heat and cook, stirring, until it starts to boil. Add the nuts (pumpkin seeds will pop) and continue cooking until you obtain a golden caramel color. Remove from the heat and add the baking soda and salt. Stir rapidly, being careful not to burn yourself from the steam, and then pour onto the prepared pan. Spread rapidly to your desired thickness. Let cool, and then break apart with your hands if it is thin or cut with an oiled knife into desired shapes. (If you choose to cut the brittle into shapes, do so while it is cooling but still somewhat warm. Once the brittle is completely cool it will break.) These can be stored in an airtight container in a cool, dry area. Use pieces of parchment paper between them so they dont stick to eack other. They will keep for a few weeks.\n",

The caramel sauce is ready when it coats the back of your spoon and resembles the thickness of gravy as it drizzles. If you have a candy thermometer available, the temperature I look for is 250-275F.

Crumb crusts need not be baked before filling, but if used unbaked, must be first chilled thoroughly or the filling will immediately disintegrate the crust. If baked before filling, they require a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes. It is best to cool the empty baked shell before filling. Fill a prebaked shell with chiffon fillings, bavarian creams, or gelatin whips topped with sweetened whipped cream, or with custard or fruit filling, which may be covered with a high meringue.\n",

      "Coat an 8-by-8-inch baking dish with butter. Cut a piece of parchment paperit should be a little less than 8 inches wide and long enough so that it rides over two sides of the dish when pressed into it. Press the parchment paper flat into the baking dish, creasing the paper at the corners. Coat the parchment-lined pan with more butter and place it on a wire rack. Place the cream in a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium-high heat and bring to a boil, about 3 minutes. Stir in the sugar, corn syrup, and brown sugar and return to a boil, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon until the sugars have dissolved, about 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium and keep the mixture at a gently rolling boil, stirring occasionally, until it reaches 255 degrees F on an instant-read thermometer, about 20 to 25 minutes. (It will reach 225 degrees F very quickly but then very slowly rise toward 255 degrees F.) Remove the pan from heat, add the butter, vanilla, and 2 1/2 teaspoons of the fleur de sel, and stir until the butter has melted and the mixture is combined. Pour into the prepared dish and let cool until the surface of the caramel is set and the dish is only slightly warm, about 1 hour. Place the dish in the freezer until the caramel is just firm, about 15 to 20 minutes (do not let it freeze for too long). Run a knife along the edges of the caramel. Using the exposed edges of parchment paper, pull the caramel slab from the pan, flip it over onto a work surface, and remove the parchment. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 teaspoon fleur de sel and press gently so that the salt adheres to the caramel. Cut into 3/4-inch squares. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer all of the caramels to the baking sheet (making sure they dont touch) and place in the refrigerator to harden again. Bring a medium saucepan filled with 1 to 2 inches of water to a simmer over high heat; once simmering, turn off the heat. Place 18 ounces of the chocolate in a dry, heatproof bowl. Set the bowl over the saucepan and, using a rubber spatula, stir until the chocolate has completely melted and has reached 118 degrees F. (Make sure the chocolate does not come into contact with any water or exceed 120 degrees F.) Remove the bowl from the saucepan. Add the remaining 6 ounces chocolate and stir until all of the chocolate has melted and the temperature has cooled to 80 degrees F. (To speed this step up, you can place the bowl of chocolate over a bowl of ice waterbut only once all of the chocolate has melted.) Once cooled, return the bowl of chocolate to the saucepan and stir until the chocolate reaches 88 degrees F; immediately remove from heat. Do not remove the thermometer from the bowl; check the temperature periodically to make sure it stays between 87 degrees F and 89 degrees F. (The chocolate must remain in this temperature range while dipping the caramels or it will not set properly.) Keep the saucepan of water over low heat and, when needed, set the bowl of chocolate over it to reheat. To test if the chocolate is properly tempered, spread a thin layer on a piece of parchment paper and place it in the refrigerator for 3 minutes to set. If the chocolate hardens smooth and without streaks, it is properly tempered. (If it is not properly tempered, let the melted chocolate harden and start the tempering process over again: Bring the chocolate up to 118 degrees F, then down to 80 degrees F, then up again to 88 degrees F.) Line a second baking sheet with parchment paper. Remove the caramels from the refrigerator. Drop a caramel into the chocolate and, using a dinner fork, turn it to coat. Lift it out of the chocolate and tap the fork several times on the edge of the bowl. Scrape the bottom of the fork against the edge of the bowl to remove any excess chocolate. Place the coated caramel on the empty baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining caramels, using the first baking sheet when the second sheet is full and making sure the caramels do not touch. Let sit until the chocolate sets. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.\n",

      "Measure your flour, salt, garlic powder, parsley, and baking powder into a big bowl. Stir the dry ingredients together so that they are evenly distributed throughout the flour. Now, pour in the milk. Stir with a big spoon until you have a ball of dough that leaves the sides of the bowl. You may have to dust the ball of dough with a little flour if it seems sticky to you. Gently knead the ball of dough right there in the bowl 5 or 6 times. Now place your dough on the counter. You may use a piece of waxed paper under the dough if you like. Using a rolling pin roll out the dough to a rectangular shape. If the edges become uneven, use your hands to reshape into a rectangle. It doesn't have to be perfect. You are aiming for a rectangle that will fi into a 9- by 13-inch pan. When you get the dough the right size, set it aside. Meanwhile, place the margarine in the 9- by 13-inch pan and place the pan in a 425F oven to melt the margarine. When the margarine is melted, carefully remove the pan from the oven, so as not to burn yourself. Sprinkle the second teaspoon of garlic powder and the 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the pan. You do not have to use the extra salt. Now, very carefully, lay your rectangle of dough into the pan, over top of the margarine. Next cut the rectangle into narrow strips. One method of doing this is to cut the dough in half, then cut each half again, quartering the dough, and then cut each quarter into narrow strips. The margarine will creep up between the strips. This is normal. It is what gives these bread sticks their texture. After cutting your strips, place the pan in the oven, still at 425F, and bake them for 20 minutes. They will be browned and crispy when they are done. The parsley is simply for decoration. It makes the bread sticks look more gourmet, but it adds little to the flavor or the texture. Leave it out if you don't have any, or are running low. If desired, you may sprinkle the bread sticks with a little bit of parmesan cheese before or after baking. This tastes good, but once again, is optional.\n",

      "Preheat oven to 300. Spread the olives on a large baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until they have shriveled a bit and are slightly crunchy, but not crisped or burned. Let them cool in the pan (they'll dry more and become a bit crunchier). Meanwhile, cut off the root end of each onion, but don't peel them. In a small saucepan, heat 2 cups water and the vinegar to a boil and drop in all the onions, cook for 5 - 10 minutes, depending on their size, until they feel soft all the way through when you squeeze them, but not mushy. Drain and let them cool. Remove the skin (or pop the onion out of the skin by squeezing at the top). If the onions are 3/4\" or more, slice them open and flake them apart, separating the layers; tiny onions can be left whole. Toss the olives, onions, and orange zest in a bowl. Dress with the oil and juice to taste. Marinate briefly or overnight, refrigerated, if you want. Serve at room temperature in a shallow bowl with a serving spoon.\n",

      "Instructions: \n",
      "\n",
      "Wrap the grapes in well washed cheesecloth, tying the corners to form a bag; lightly crush them with a rolling pin (to release the sugar to mix with the natural yeast on the skins; just like making wine!) and immerse them in the flour water mix. Cover tightly with a lid or plastic wrap secured with a rubber band. Leave at room temperature for 6 days, stirring once or twice a day for six days. The bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated, and liquid will begin to separate from the flour base. The mixture will begin to taste and smell slightly fruity, and the color will be strange. That is as it should be. By the sixth day the bag of grapes will have deflated, the color will be yellow, and the taste pleasantly sour; the fermentation is complete. The starter is living but weak, and it needs to be fed. Remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter. Stir it up thoroughly and transfer it to a clean container. (Although you can use it after just one feeding, the starter will be stronger and healthier with the full treatment) You can refrigerate it until you're ready to proceed. Three days before you plan to use it, stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup water into the container, blending well. Let stand uncovered at room temperature until it bubbles up 3 to 4 hours then cover and refrigerate. Repeat this the second and third day. Store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months, after which its a good idea to pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding. Before using the stored starter for bread, however, give it the full 3-day feeding schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness.\n",

Cover loosely (leave lid open a crack) and allow to rise for two hours at room temperature (if you decreased the yeast, youll need more time). NEVER PUNCH DOWN or intentionally deflate. The dough will rise and then begin to collapse. Refrigerate and use over the next 14 days, tearing off one-pound loaves as you need them. On baking day, cut off a grapefruit-sized piece of dough (about a pound), using a serrated knife or a kitchen shears. Quickly shape the loaf by pulling the top around to the bottom and rotating, but don't knead. Cover the loaf loosely with plastic wrap and let it rest on a pizza peel covered with cornmeal or parchment for 90 minutes (or 40 if your dough is fresh and not refrigerate). Thirty minutes before baking, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), with a baking stone placed on a middle rack. Place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other rack that wont interfere with rising bread. Just before baking, use a pastry brush to paint the top with water and sprinkle with a seed mixture if desired. Slash the loaf with 1/4-inch deep parallel cuts across the top (or a singe lengthwise cut as in the first picture). Use a serrated bread knife held perpendicularly to the loaf. Slide the dough onto the pizza stone. Pour 1 cup hot tap water into the broiler tray. Bake for about 30 minutes or until done.\n",

      "Put the water and miso in a small pan, and heat up until just before it begins to boil. By killing the micro-organisms in the miso this way, the dough won't be so loose and will be much easier to handle. Once the miso cools down, add enough water so that the mixture comes to 105 to 115 g, because some water will have evaporated. Put all the ingredients in a bread machine. Select the knead-only program, knead for 7 minutes only, then stop the program! Transfer the dough to an oiled bowl. Don't over knead this dough! Leave to rise properly, until the dough has increased by 2 1/2 to 3 times in volume. The dough will contain lots of air bubbles at this point, so wait patiently. Take the dough out very gently so as not to lose those bubbles and place onto a flour dusted work surface. Round it off lightly and leave to rest for 15 minutes. If you want to divide it into 2, do so at this stage. I formed the loaves into long thin baguettes following bread master Tsukakei's instructions. Form into shapes with canvas or something similar and leave to rise again (2nd rising). They have risen enough when they have doubled in size. Preheat the oven with the baking sheets inside. Slash the tops of the loaves with a knife, mist with water, and put into the oven with the kitchen parchment paper onto the hot baking sheet. My oven doesn't have a steam function, so I put in some glass containers filled with boiling water along with the bread. My oven is rather weak, so I bake it at 250 C for 30 minutes, but please adjust the time and temperature to your own oven. Baked. The slash got puffy and expanded. How the inside looks. It tastes cheesy rather than like miso. It's a bit sour and has a deep flavor. The air bubbles are so-so...Since it contains miso, the crumb is a bit brown. It smells rather like there's rye flour in the bread! The crust is thin and crispy, very nice. I tried making this one using the autolyse method (mixing the flour and water together and letting it sit for a while before adding the yeast etc. )The bread was springy and aromatic and had a great texture.\n",

Don't give me a low score for bitter taste because you have to rinse it well first! Put the quinoa in a deep bowl and pour cold water over it. With a fork or whisk, stir it heavily for a couple minutes until a soapy residue is floating to the top. Strain it through a fine-mesh colander and rinse it under the tap again. Now your quinoa's ready for cooking! Bring 2 cups of water to a boil and add a little salt so the quinoa doesn't stick to the bottom. Add the olive oil and cardamom to the boiled water and let it impart for a few seconds. Add the rinsed quinoa and lower the heat to medium. Loosely cover the pot and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes or until all the quinoa pieces have fluffed out. Remove from the heat and let it stand for a few minutes, then fluff with a fork and serve.\n",

Place it in the tin, cover and leave to prove for a further hour or until doubled in size. Heat the oven to 230C/Gas 8. If you have one, put a baking stone into the oven to heat up at the same time. Sprinkle the loaf with spelt flour and sea salt and transfer to the hot oven (to the stone, if using). Spray the oven with water spray and close the door to create a crust. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove the loaf from the oven, take out of the tin and leave to cool completely.\n",

      "Prepare a screw top jar. It must be clean, dry, and not smell like it's previous contents. (Peanut butter jars work great, as well as baby food jars for smaller portions). Pour the cream into the jar, and put the lid on. You will need to leave the jar about half empty to have space to shake, so adjust the amount of cream accordingly. Shake the jar vigorously. After a bit, it will coat the sides of the jar, then become whipped cream. Keep shaking - it will start to separate. Its done when it is totally separated into butter and buttermilk. NOTE: I stopped every minute to open the jar and take a picture (and let my arm rest :-) ) and it took 7 minutes of shaking. After several reviews, I thought that I'd mention that it takes some people longer - even 20 or 30 minutes - but it is still worth the time to make :D . Pour the buttermilk into a separate container, and enjoy! A great project for school kids is to use the buttermilk to make biscuits or bread, and then eat it with the butter. While it is very soft at first, it gets rather hard as you store it in the fridge, and will need to soften if you plan to use it as a spread. (If you don't eat it all right away! ). While researching cheese making I discovered that the resulting butter milk is 'old fashioned' and purchased buttermilk is thicker as it is cultured in a process similar to yogurt. (Someone mentioned this in a review as well.) I have used it with great success in a few recipes without knowing that there was a difference.\n",

Be very careful working with this caramel as it is extremely HOT! Brush down the sides of the pan twice with a pastry brush dipped in water to prevent the mixture from crystallizing. While stirring, add the cashews. When nuts are completely coated, remove the caramel from the heat and pour onto the cookie sheet, spreading it out with the spoon.

Comments: Robert Colombi of Paris, France, writes: \"My mother was Sicilian and my father, Corsican, but I was born in Morocco and lived there for many years. As I became older, I developed a stronger interest in cooking, especially after I moved to France and got married. I guess I started to feel very nostalgic about the country of my childhood, and it became more important for me to remember and re-create those tastes for my French friends and family.\" Reminiscent of lightly fried pita bread, this rustic treat is good for breakfast. It is named after the first inhabitants of North Africa. Yield: 3 round breads\n",

Mixture will be very sticky. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and let sit in a warm place for an hour to rise. When the dough is risen, add the remaining 1/2 cup flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir to combine. Combine the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and cinnamon to make cinnamon sugar. Set aside. Move the dough to a lightly floured surface. Press to slightly flatten the dough. Sprinkle a couple tablespoons cinnamon sugar and a third of the dried cranberries over the dough. Fold the dough over on itself and flatten again. Repeat the process two more times, ending by folding the dough in on itself. Divide the dough into 12 pieces. With floured hands, quickly roll the pieces into balls. Place on a baking tray lined with parchment paper, 1 inch apart. Cover and allow to rise in a warm place for another hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. To prepare the paste for the cross topping, mix the flour and water until smoothly combined. Transfer to a piping bag with a small opening. Pipe cross on each roll. Transfer to oven and bake for 20 minutes, until golden brown on top. To prepare hot glaze, bring sugar and water to a simmer, stirring until the sugar is fully dissolved.

When the yeast mixture bubbles, add it to the other ingredients and mix. Then, begin to add the remaining 4 cups of flour in 1/2-1 cup increments. Add water in 1/4 cup intervals until the dough is smooth and only slightly sticky. Scrape the sides of the bowl with a greased spatula and make sure that all of the ingredients are mixed inches. Cover the bowl with a towel and allow the dough to rise for 10 minutes. If you are going to shape and bake your challahs immediately, cover loosely with plastic wrap and allow it to rise for 1 hour. If you are going to shape later (or the next day), place the dough into Zip-Loc bags lined with a little canola oil and refrigerate. (Remember that the dough will double in size, so leave enough room!) Remove the dough from the refrigerator 45 minutes prior to shaping. When you are ready to shape, grease your hands and the workspace with a little canola oil. Stack two baking trays on top of eachother and line the top with parchment paper (doubling up the baking trays prevents the bottom of the challahs from burning). Then, shape the challahs (be careful not to overwork the challah). If the dough is too sticky, use oil (don't use flour). Place the finished challahs on the baking sheet. Cover the challahs loosely with plastic wrap and allow to rest. Mix an egg glaze (mix 1 egg and some canola oil together). Preheat the oven to 350. When the oven reaches the temperature, brush the challahs gently with the egg glaze as evenly as possible. Place the challahs in the oven to bake. After about 20 minutes, begin to check on the challahs. Take them out as soon as they are golden brown. Remove them from the oven and allow them to cool. When they are cool, pack them in plastic bags. You can also freeze them, by placing them in Zip-Loc bags. Enjoy your challahs and have a beautiful Shabbos!\n",

      "=Let's make the water-drained yogurt= place a sieve on top of a bowl, and prepare it with two sheets of paper towels stacked together. Add in the plain yogurt; fold the paper over top of it, place a flat-bottomed plate on top, and use the jam jar etc. in place of a weight, and drain the water for about 30 minutes. Please weight it if you're worried about it, and it's ok if it weighs about 250~280g! (It's also okay if there is a bit extra. Adjust the amount with whey if there isn't enough). Add the sugar to the heavy cream, then whip it. *Make sure not to whip it too hard. (I use 35% fat cream for this). Pour the drained yogurt into a bowl, and use a rubber spatula to knead until smooth. Add the condensed milk to that. Mix Step 5 together until smooth. Mix Steps 4 and 6 together, then pour out into a container and chill in the fridge. (Take it out of the fridge several times, and mix each time to make it turn out smooth.) Open a hole with a spoon when eating if it has solidified, and add in the jam. Place into the fridge once more and let solidify well. Serve with ice cream and other similar dishes and it's done. It's convenient to use freezing containers normally used for rice as well. It will freeze quickly in a doughnut mold, and it looks like an ice cream cup as-is . This recipe yields 4-5 servings. If you are turning these into ice cream bars, then use the jam to make a marble pattern, pack into the containers, and chill to solidify. (I used fruit jam in the photo). =Adding in Marshmallows= Cut up 30g of marshmallows with a pair of kitchen scissors. For those of you that want to leave the shape of the marshmallows intact, please add them in during Step 8. I added it to a waffle cone shell. This will save you time of decorating when you eat it . Please feel free to enjoy it in a variety of ways!\n",

Push the mussels and pippies into the rice and cook until the shells open. Finally add the peas, strips of capsicum and parsley and leave it for five more minutes on low heat.

It will help to distribute it through the paella evenly giving a better colour and flavour to the finished dish. - The perfect time to add the seafood to paella is when enough of the stock has been absorbed to allow the rice to be seen. - Do not stir the paella during main cooking.\n",

Meanwhile put your yogurt in a small bowl and let come to room temperature. When your jars are sterilized quickly place the empty jars into the cooler and close the lid. This will keep the jars warm and warm up the incubator. When the milk has cooled down remove 1/2 cup and whisk it into the yogurt. Return the mixture to the pan. Add the vanilla and stir to distribute. Take your jars out of the cooler and replace the lid. Transfer yogurt to jars and put their lids/caps on. Place them into the cooler and wind a kitchen towel around the jars to hold more warmth. Replace the lid and forget about the yogurt for 5 hours. If after 5 hours your yogurt still seems a little runny just let them sit another hour. During that time don't fiddle with the cooler. It seems long winded, but it really is simple.\n",

      "Put the olive oil and vegetable oil in a clean, dry, medium-sized pot over a medium heat. Heat until the oil for approximately 1-2 minutes, or until a test almond dropped in the oil starts to slowly emit a stream of bubbles. Ready a plate lined with paper towels and a slotted spoon and add the almonds to the oil. Fry the almonds, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. When they start to emit a toasty aroma and are a medium-brown, remove the pan from the heat and start removing them from the pan. Some of the nuts in the pan may start to crack as you work. When that happens, move quickly, since they will burn if you leave them in the oil too long. Using a slotted spoon, remove the almonds from the oil and put them on the lined plate to drain. Allow the almonds to cool away from the range. Some of them might be slightly cracked, but over all they should be aromatic and smell a bit like toast. While the nuts are cooling, put a medium saute pan over a medium-high heat. Put the butter in the pan. When it has started melting, add the curry powder and chopped rosemary to the pan. Stir. When the butter mixture is foaming and the curry powder and rosemary aromas become much stronger, remove the pan from the heat. Add the fried almonds to the butter mixture and toss to coat. Add the Maldon salt. Put the almonds in a heatproof bowl and allow to cool for 5 minutes. Serve while warm topped with a sprig of rosemary, and a gritty who-done-it.\n",

      "Chop the chocolate: Use a chef's knife to chop the chocolate as finely as possible; this will help it melt quickly and evenly. Then place it in a medium glass bowl. (Glass retains heat, so the chocolate will stay melted longer.) Make the ganache: Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until bubbles form around the edge. Remove from the heat and add about one-fourth of the chocolate; whisk until smooth. Slowly pour the cream mixture over the remaining chocolate in the bowl and let sit until the chocolate melts, about 30 seconds. Puree the melted chocolate with an immersion blender or beat with a whisk until all the lumps disappear and the ganache is smooth. Stir in the butter until smooth, then add liqueur, if desired. (Jacques adds the liqueur last, so the flavor doesn't cook off.) Pour and set: Line a rimmed baking sheet with plastic wrap, leaving a 2-foot overhang on one side. Pour the ganache onto the baking sheet and spread evenly with a rubber spatula. Fold the plastic wrap back over and press directly onto the surface of the ganache. Let cool at room temperature at least 4 hours or overnight. For the truffles: Using two teaspoons, scoop small mounds of the ganache onto parchment-lined baking sheets. Set aside until firm enough to roll, about 15 minutes in the refrigerator or 2 hours at room temperature. Roll into balls: Place the chocolate mounds between both palms, squeeze slightly and roll. Refrigerate until ready to coat. Temper the chocolate: This is a gentle melting and cooling process that gives chocolate a glossy finish. For the coating, place the chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water and stir until melted, about 40 minutes. Pour into a clean glass bowl; stir to cool to between 88 degrees and 90 degrees, about 40 minutes. (Jacques recommends a laser thermometer for checking the temperature.) Dip and coat: Spread out the cocoa powder, coconut and nuts on parchment paper. One at a time, dip each truffle in the tempered chocolate with a two-prong dipping fork (you can buy one at a baking-supply store or break off the middle tines of a plastic fork). Lift the truffle and let the excess chocolate drip off. Roll in toppings and place on a rack to dry. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks. Photograph by Jim Franco\n",

Work the butter into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter or two forks until it is incorporated, and the mixture resembles wet sand. Pour the banana-yogurt mixture into the flour-butter mixture and stir just until all of the dry ingredients are incorporated. Line a large circular plate with wax paper and place the dough onto the plate. Spread the dough out to the edges of the plate, into a 1-inch thick disk and cover with another piece of wax paper. Place the dough into the freezer and let it sit for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silpat liner. Peel the wax paper from the top of the scone dough and turn the plate over onto the lined baking sheet. Peel off the second layer of wax paper and slice the scones into 8 equal wedges. Pull them apart just slightly to allow room to expand while baking. Bake for 25-30 minutes until the outer edges are firm and golden brown. Remove from the oven and cut any edges that baked together. While the scones bake, make the glaze by melting the butter in a small bowl in the microwave. Pour in the milk and maple syrup and stir well. Slowly add in the powdered sugar in 1/2-cup increments until the glaze reaches a consistency that you like. I like mine a little thicker so sometimes I even use a little more than three cups. But, if you would rather have a bit of a runnier glaze, you can use less. Glaze the scones while they are still a bit warm.\n",

Knead the mixture in the bowl for a minute. (The purpose of the kneading is not to develop gluten, as with yeast dough, but simply to mix the dough thoroughly-so dont overdo it.) If the dough is too sticky to handle, add a little more flour. Shape the dough into a ball about 8 inches in diameter and place on the prepared pan. Dip a sharp knife in flour and use it to make two deep cuts into the loaf (almost-but not quite-to the bottom) in the shape of a plus sign. As the bread bakes, the cuts will spread apart. Bake for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and spread out like an open flower. Cool on a wire rack. To serve, pull the bread apart at the cut lines and tear off pieces.\n",

In a large bowl using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat the butter, sugar, dissolved coffee and vanilla extract until blended and smooth, about 1 minute. Reduce the speed to low and add the flour mixture, mixing until the flour is incorporated and the dough holds together. At first the dough will form fine crumbs; then it will come together in large clumps. Divide the dough in half and shape each portion into a smooth ball. Place 1 piece of dough between 2 large pieces of wax paper and roll it out to slightly less than 1/4 inch thick. Remove the top piece of wax paper. Using a 2 1/2-inch star cutter, cut out cookies. Slide a thin metal spatula under each cookie to loosen it, and place the cookies about 1 inch apart on the prepared baking sheets. Bake the cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until the tops feel firm and look dull rather than shiny, about 15 minutes. Cool the cookies on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with the second piece of dough, and then press all of the dough scraps together to form a smooth ball. Repeat the rolling and cutting process. For the icing: Dip a fork in the melted white chocolate and drizzle it randomly and generously over the tops of the cooled cookies. Immediately sprinkle with crushed peppermint candy. The candy will stick to the warm chocolate. Let the cookies sit until the chocolate is firm. The cookies can be stored between layers of wax paper in a tightly covered container at room temperature for up to 4 days.\n",

      "1. Heat your oven to 350 Degrees. 2. Combine dry and wet ingredients 3. Mix until moist and fully combined (Sometimes the butter is hard to mix in so make sure it's mixed in fully before baking). 4. Use a non stick cooking spray or line your pan with baking cups. 5. Fill each cup to about 3/4 full. 6. Put in oven for about 40 minutes (I know it might seem like a long time, but time varies for different ovens and mine is older so it took a little longer). 7. When muffins have cooked fully or have gotten a nice golden brown top, pull from the oven an let it sit on a cool surface for 5-10 minutes. 8. Enjoy! A good tip is to top the muffins with a little sugar (regular or brown in the later stages of baking to add a nice crust) These also taste good with a little cream cheese. Note: Don't be surprised if these don't rise too high.\n",

If you prefer, you can remove the skin on the peanuts (this will make for a more smooth final texture). In a medium mixing bowl, combine peanuts with salt and honey. Using a spoon, mix well so that all the peanuts are evenly coated. Lay peanuts out evenly and in one layer over the baking tray. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until well-browned and dark, but not burnt. Halfway though, toss peanuts using a spatula. This will ensure even roasting. Remove from oven and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Add peanuts into a food processor and run it for 1 minute. Remove the lid and press the peanuts back down along the sides using a spatula. Replace the lid and turn food processor back on for an additional two minutes. Repeat with spatula if needed. The consistency of the peanuts will change but dont worry. After two minutes, slowly drizzle the oil into the food processor while it is running. Process until smooth, about 1-2 more minutes. Adjust flavor as desired by adding more salt, honey or even a pinch of cinnamon. Place in an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 2 months. Note: If you prefer a quicker method, skip the roasting of the peanuts and buy a pack of honey-roasted peanuts instead.\n",

Flatten the dough out with your hands or with a rolling pin so its about 1 1/2 inches thick. I usually just use my hands to do this (one less dish to wash) but do whatever you are comfortable with. Using a 2 round cutter, cut out as many rounds as you can get out of the dough. You should get about a dozen. You can re-roll the scraps to make additional biscuits.

Divide the dough into two portions using a scraper. Form each portion into round balls, cover with plastic wrap, and rest for 15 minutes. After letting them rest, they should have expanded a little. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until about 30 cm long. Fold it into thirds and then roll it up starting with the side closest you. Tightly seal the seams closed. Do the same for the other portion. Place into the bread pan with the seam side down. Spray the dough with water, cover with a lid, and let them rise a second time for about 30 minutes.

Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a heavy, deep saucepan or pot over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the sugar is dissolved. Continue cooking until the mixture starts to turn golden, then swirl lightly to caramelize evenly. Remove from the heat and whisk in the cream mixture, being very careful because it will bubble up and steam. Once it stops bubbling, return the mixture to the heat and continue to cook, adjusting the heat to maintain a constant soft simmer, until it reaches 248F on a candy thermometer, about 15 minutes. Stir in the pistachios and pour into the prepared pan. Let sit for 2 to 3 hours, until cool to the touch. Cut into 1-inch pieces and wrap each piece in a piece of cellophane or wax paper, twisting the ends to secure. Store in an airtight container in a cool, dry place for about 1 month. The punto, the exact moment when the candy is ready varies not only between different types of candy but also with relation to personal preference. It is one of the most important aspects of the candy making process because it defines the texture. Throughout my travels, whenever I asked someone when theyd know their creation was ready, they always responded when it reaches the punto. I didnt find one person in Mexico who relied on thermometers or cared to have one. They rely on their senses and experience and are artisans in the truest sense of the word.\n",

      "Preheat oven to 350 F (180 C). In a small dutch oven or large saucepan, combine honey, peanut butter (try to find a brand that has no added suger, salt or other ingredients; ideally it should only contain peanuts), chicken broth, and peanut oil. Heat, stirring often, until mixture begins to simmer. Remove from heat. Stir in rolled oats and oat bran and let cool until lukewarm -- or cool enough to work with. Gradually blend in oat flour, adding enough to form a stiff dough. Transfer to a floured (oat flour or rye flour) surface and knead until smooth (about 3-5 minutes). Shape the dough into a ball, and roll to 1/4-inch (6 mm) thick. Use a mini-cookie cutter or cut into small squares. Transfer to ungreased baking sheets, spacing them about 1/4 inch (6 mm) apart. Gather up the scraps, roll out again, and. cut additional biscuits. If the dough becomes too crumbly to work with after a few rollings,sprinkle with a little water to bind it together and knead it for 30 seconds or so. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from oven and turn over. Bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until golden brown on both sides. After you finish baking all batches of biscuits, turn off the oven, spread all the biscuits in one baking pan and set them in the oven to cool for a few hours or overnight. The extra time in the oven as it cools off helps make the treats crispier. These make a more delicate crunchy biscuit, so we use them more for special or training treats, not tartar control. Makes several dozen small treats that keep and freeze well.\n",

Cut the butter into the flour mixturebasically, just quickly rub the butter into the flour with your hands until the mixture is coarse and resembles cornmeal. 3. Stir milk and corn kernels (if youre using them) into the mixture. Turn dough out onto a floured cutting board and knead the reserved flour (1/4 cup) into the dough until it is no longer sticky. (You may need to use a bit more flour if the dough is especially sticky). 4. Pat the dough out to about 1/2 inch thickness and cut into 2-inch rounds with a biscuit cutter. 5, Lightly grease a large cast-iron skillet and arrange cut biscuits in a single layer. Give them a little breathing room, because theyll rise quite a bit in the oven. Depending on the size of your skillet, you may need to bake in two batches or bake some of the biscuits on a separate baking sheet. My skillet is about 8 inches in diameter and doesnt quite fit all of the biscuits, so I bake in two batches. 6. Bake at 450 F for 13-16 minutes until biscuits are lightly browned. Serve warm with butter and a bit of honey. Theyre also great with chili or pulled pork. I love to use them for pulled pork sliders!\n",

Bring to a boil (look for a wisp of white smoke), then add walnuts. Fry for 4 to 5 minutes, or until walnuts turn light golden brown.\n",

Go on running processor until dough forms a firm ball, rides around on blade and is not at all sticky. (If you prefer, whisk together the water and oil and add this to machine all at once.) Cut dough into 12 small balls this is easiest if you cut the ball in half, then half again, then into thirds and flatten each into a 3- to 4-inch patty. On a well-floured surface, use a rolling pin to roll each patty into a 6 to 8 inch circle. The shapes can be irregular, but dough should be so thin you can almost see through it. Place dough on ungreased cookie sheets, sprinkle with sea salt if desired. You may find using a silicone baking mat helpful. Prick thoroughly and completely all over with a fork to prevent any puffing up. Bake for about 2 to 3 minutes, keeping a very close eye on breads they can burn very quickly. Once they begin to brown, flip and cook for another minute or so on the other side. Repeat with all the remaining dough and allow to cool completely on a wire rack.\n",

      "1. Preheat oven to 425*F. 2. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse meal. Gradually stir in milk until dough pulls away from the side of the bowl. 3. Turn out onto a floured surface, and knead 15 to 20 times. Pat or roll dough out to 1 inch thick. Cut biscuits with a large cutter or juice glass dipped in flour. Repeat until all dough is used. Brush off the excess flour, and place biscuits onto an ungreased baking sheet. 4. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, or until edges begin to brown. My Note: I do not substitute shortning for the butter or margarine, better flavor. For those who didn't get the desired results -- Try these tips: The instructions say to knead 14-15 TIMES, NOT 14-15 minutes! The object is to handle the dough as little as possible. 1.Don't overmix the dough once you add the milk and only pat together (no real \"kneading\" or they will be tough). 2.only add the amount of milk you need, some days i have to use it all and then others I have a little left in the cup. 3. make sure the butter is cold 4.can brush with melted butter before and/or after baking for added softness and flavor and 5. can place closer together if yours still aren't soft. If you're new to biscuits, remember - any time you make biscuits (or scones or anything else that uses baking powder or soda to rise) you want to gently mix the dough JUST until the ingredients are all mixed-- don't maul it or knead it. The more you handle your dough the more the gluten develops and the tougher your biscuits (or pie crust, etc.) will be. The only drawback was that they were bland and definitely had a slight baking powder taste. I made them a second time and substituted cultured buttermilk powder (4 TBS Saco brand) + 1 Celsius water in place of the milk; dropped the baking powder back to 2 tsp; and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. Oh my goodness -- perfection -- so flavorful and soft and fluffy! Absolutely the best I've ever made or eaten - Hope these tip's help and thank you so much doing. I do know that the barometer affects how your biscuits turn out, (works the same with anything with yeast, such as bread) so, if it's raining or very humid, they won't rise as well. If it's hot and dry, they should rise beautifully. So I kind of go by that when I am adding the liquid and flour (amounts). After you've made enough biscuits, you can tell how their going to turn out by how the (uncooked) dough looks and feels. I was thinking about the post that said they turned out dry on the outside and moist inside, if they seem very hard, then I would think possibly, they were cooked at too high a temperature and/or were left in too long. Because my oven is very hot, I always turn it down by 25 degrees, and never assume that the time stated is going to be \"perfect\" for my oven, so I checked these after 10 minutes, and then watched them 2 to 3 minutes after. Anyway, you should enjoy these.\n",

When they are shriveled and getting dry, remove them and allow them to cool. A little more moisture will evaporate. Return to the oven if you feel they need to cook more.

Remove from the skillet and allow to cool completely in a bowl. Turn the heat to medium and toast the sesame seeds, then the coriander seeds, then the cumin seeds, toasting just until fragrant and removing as soon as they are toasted. Allow all of the seeds to cool completely. Grind half the pumpkin seeds and all of the sesame seeds briefly in a spice mill and add to the bowl with the remaining pumpkin seeds. When the coriander and cumin have cooled, grind to a powder and add to the pumpkin seeds and sesame seeds. Add the nigella seeds, chili powder and salt and mix together.

      "Dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the warm water. Let stand for 5-10 minutes. (You can add a pinch of sugar to aid the yeast.) Combine flours, seeds, salt and flax meal. Pour remaining 2 cups of warm water, honey and oil in a large bowl. Add the yeast and then two cups of the flour/seed mixture. Stir until you have a ragged dough. At this point you can start kneading your dough. Add the remaining flour/seed mixture 1- 1 1/2 cups at a time until you have all of it kneaded together evenly. Place the bread dough in an oiled bowl. Cover with wax paper sprayed with oil and a damp tea towel. Place in a warm spot for 1- 1 1/2 hours or until it has doubled in size. Punch the dough down and divide in two equal portions. Shape each portion into a bun and place each into an oiled bread pan. Cover these with the waxed paper and tea towel. Let rise for an additional 20 minutes. Place loaves in a preheated 450 degree oven. After 10 minutes, reduce to 350 degrees and bake for an additional 30 minutes. Remove from oven and cool on a rack.\n",

In a food processor, grind nuts, sugar and salt to a fine meal. In a mixer, beat flour and butter together on low speed until texture is sandy. Add nut mixture and mix on low until dough starts to form small lumps; keep mixing until dough just holds together when pinched between fingers. Do not use wet fingers: the cookies will collapse. Pinch off about a teaspoon of dough and place in palm of your hand. With tips of fingers, pinch and press dough together until cookie has a flat bottom and pointed top, like a rough pyramid. Cookies need not be perfectly smooth or equal size. Place on parchment about 1 inch apart. Bake about 15 minutes, rotating cookie sheets halfway through. Cookies should be turning golden brown on edges. Cool on sheets 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks and cool completely before storing in airtight containers up to 1 week.\n",
